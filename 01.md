# 1 Chapter 1 What is the key ability to enhance the learning?

To build this book, it is not very easy to write.

The reason is that "learning" itself is a very big topic. There is also a lot of changes affecting this result.

So, when I am writing this book, although it is possible to write a lot, it cuts into the schedule order from which angle is cut. Also let me hurt myself.

The final version that can be published, the foot is overwritten for three or four times, and the anti-adjustment is found to find the most appropriate arrangement.

## What is it? And why do we love this thing and hate?

"Learning" is the skills that we will use every minute every minute.

But talk about "learning", our feelings of this matter always float a complex feel.

We know "learning" will eventually bring us good. But on the one hand, we have hated the process, and the consumption time but the final result output is very unstable.

In the end, almost vast people have chosen "escape" options.

This also caused "learning" this behavior, although it takes a lot of life in our lives. But in relatively speaking, many people have only spend very little heart to solve this problem.

In fact, we don't want it. Instead, talk about the ability to enhance learning ability, sometimes it is like a thick wall that is different. We used to do our best to break the result. It is not that the fist is inserted.

The card is in the middle of the road we want to reach the realm, so that we are both nausea and heart.

### We have confused "Natural Learning" and "deliberate learning"

Why do there sceally? I want to talk about what is learning.

According to the definition of Wikipedia, learning is divided into two kinds of narrowness and general meaning:

- Narrow: through reading, listening, research, observation, understanding, exploration, experiment, practice, etc., is a process that makes individuals can continue to change (knowledge and skills, methods and processes, emotional and value improvement And sublimation) behavior. For example, the process of obtaining knowledge through school education.
- Generally: It is a relatively long-lasting behavior of behavior or behavioral potential of behavior or behavioral potential of people in life.

General meaning. We are all between "Download experience from the outside world", which is the so-called "natural study". We have this ability to be born. After reading the demonstration of others, there is a way to imitate the operation. Through the fall, there is a pothole hole on this road, and the next time I will be careful.

Such an upgrade result allows us to master more certainty for various execution results. Make more efficiency when the same thing is performed next time. Not don't say, when you overcome the problem, the moment of joy.

So our born is actually very passionate about learning.

However, why we hate learning.

It can be complained that there are too many facts:

- Sometimes in the field of Work in a field, get a bloodstream in the field
- Sometimes exhausted, but nothing
- The process of class is too painful, very similar to the sentence
- To solve a problem, it is overwhelmed by Shu Mountain. I have been in the old half-day, I don't know where to answer.
- I spent a lot of time, I forgot it in an instant.
- ....

This list, continue to expand, write a few tens of lines.

But the key is, why do we have love for it?

Because, I really want to say. This is actually two things.

- I like: You like the process and results of nature learning
- I hate: You hate the process and results of deliberate learning

The reason why we feel this is the same. Because our life, it has the ability to learn naturally. After a brief free study time (1-6 years old). Quickly moved into a wrong hell learning environment (6-18 years old national education), download some similar to not learning methods. And we have been brainwash them by these messy methods. Mistaken to think that these methods are also the correct learning method. Finally, the result of the two methods will feel mixed together.

So finally appeared "Nature" is very happy, but "deliberate" is very painful when using these "learning methods".

Therefore, the reason why we have this topic of "learning" is complicated. In fact, because in this field, two "purpose" different solutions, results, emotions were confused. I don't know if I use, what is correct, what is wrong. Worse, you feel that there will be a phenomenon of Xue Dinger, that is, the process and results are uncertain.

Therefore, most of the society, for learning this word, even there will be PTSD (trauma syndromes). When I heard these two words, I feel fear, and the consciousness is closed to "learning".

## Humans have always used the wrong Raiders to play new games

After discussing these two feelings, you will find that as human, the ability of natural learning is not broken. Because it is our ability to be inherent. In our daily life, the time to correct the results in our previous behavior, the resulting result, this ability is "Natural Learning".

However, if you talk about "deliberate learning". It can be said that everyone is using quite touches, as long as the topic is bigger, the process is painful and the result is a skeleton.

In theory, if we don't touch the theme of "deliberate learning", life can be happy. This book is also written here. (what)

But in fact, we can't escape. This is even more like this in the past two hundred years. Before this, most humans have always been a smooth farming hunting life, and the environment has not changed too much. Therefore, even if the ability to "deliberately study" is not good, light is relying on built-in "natural learning", and can live a life.

However, between the past two hundred years, the change in the world is huge. Light begins to popular from the personal computer, and go to the home to go online. If you have to use your mobile phone to do everything, just spend three or forty years. The advancement of technology is far more than the speed of normal learning of human nature.

We have never adapted to the surrounding environment through constant natural learning. But now the environment has changed the environment, but if we don't have a "deliberate learning", it will even be able to survive, even quickly eliminated. Severe words, even life inch is difficult (for example, mobile payment and scan clearance)

The productivity of different fields is getting higher and higher under the aid of automatic tools. There are also more and more new methods and processes to be invented.

Therefore, "deliberate learning" is very important on the road to keep up with social changes.

This is also why our society has created a "education system", "deliberately training" our "deliberate practice".

But frankly, but this system, is it helpful to overcome the times?

According to the final actual output, I want to evaluate and the results in the society in the society, I think it is "not used". More even, it is very harmful.

### 错 的 The model makes humans have been using the wrong policies, and even finally generates an error mentality.

In theory, our school is in order to increase the results of students "deliberate learning".

The establishment of the whole school education is to simulate a relatively secure environment, so that the students learn the knowledge and methods of the future society will use, so that the whole society can receive a batch of high quality, learning methods, Can keep up with the adults of society.

However, the idea said this is like this. Execution is not the case. Even became a serious reaction.

How to say? I have painted a form, you know where the problem is.

! [] (iMages / 20211023114108.png)

Post this form, it may make readers very scared.

Dig, as if you find any new mainland.

In fact, the light pasted this picture, this book is written here, it seems to be honest. (what)

We have a deep and painful impression of learning. And very uncomfortable from the workplace life after graduation, I feel that my ability is very low, I have no ability to update. In fact, it is because of school.

Theoretical school design is because we want to make your next generation with the ability to deliberately study. In fact, let them learn a wrong way, and thus destroy their willingness and ability to learn.

This set of structures, from macro, essentially assume a world that does not change, so that participants pursue in the inside of the test paper. And pursue average multi-angle development.

However, we are in an adult society, but we are not such an environment and challenge. The ability to survive in the society is to face unknown environments, quickly find the idea development solution, and the measurement of the achievement standards, a single-cortexed deserted peak.

The school education covers the human essence time 12-16 years, when young humans enter this system, there are many white paper, and there is a certain level of learning. Our standards, methods, comparison standards, and methods of establishing objectives, are from school for solution design methods.

But after so many years of exercise, many people have entered the society, but they don't feel "school" to help us prepare. Instead, I feel that I haven't used what I have learned.

After so many years of premium, many graduates even continuously learn the will of life, and believe that they even lost their update.

### Change to a new and correct thinking to play games

I believe that this book readers should have played a lot of different kinds of games. You should know how different games should be used, and you should use different strategies to play, break.

For example, it is not possible to use the instant strategic type. Although there are some individual build elements in these two games, it is essentially a different type of game.

If you use a wrong game method, it will usually be difficult to pass, or even in advance.

This is also the case.

In the learning circles, there are so many strange phenomena, in essence, actually because we have been holding a game Raiders in playing B game! Then the game process is very fierce, the process is time, and there is no results, nature is normal.

Back to the origin of this chapter, what is the key to enhancing the motivation?

I think it is necessary to realize that the school simulation and social needs are actually different games.

Once you know what you are in what game you are. It is already 50% success.

Because humans themselves will naturally switch different implementations because of the difference in the goals.

So, when you are awake realized that this is two different games, the rules of the game are distinct, and naturally, they will accept the new gameplay, even actively explore effective methods.

I want readers when I read this book, I just started tangled, if we now go to learn new methods. What should I do if the old method does?

Do Not Worry,

- First of all, the way we first learned in school, it is too broken, and it is not a pity.
- Again, in fact, I will have a way in this book, almost all human nature is old. This book is just a combination of "correct" arrangement, thus making powerful power.

This book reads up in the first time, although it will make you a bit shocking and hard. But I promise you that as long as you spend two or three hours, you can absolutely begin to generate the effect I declared above, and it is an immediate change.

## rpg game v.s. Memory fill in the game

SO. How do we take the first step?

First, you already know that we have to play is a new game. This is already enough to change a lot.

Second, our life, essentially a "rpg" game. You are just in the earth, playing yourself. We are playing roles playing, not playing an oversized "filled memory game".

You may feel that you will feel unfortunately throw away.

But the new game rules are like this:

- Just specialize in projects that like to be good at, the shortest time gets the highest points.
- What is the strange means can be used, and you can do it in the legal behavior.
- The more skilful EXP will index, and the speed is twice that of others. The return is 4 times that of others. The speed is three times that of others, and the return is 9 times that of others. In this class, the index type is given.
- The standard for achievement is not perfect copy to get 100 points less buckle. But encourage crazy to try the next round, get better and better, crazy stacking buff to 10,000 points.
- High scores, money, lavish, more achievement

Looking back, do you find an old gameplay and a strategy:

- I like the discipline is forbidden to learn, I have to spend a lot of time to learn "I am not good at"
- Back a bunch of you feel boring. I don't want to do 100 points.
- Don't make mistakes, try not to try new things

Throwing away, it is not a pity?

Third, because this is an RPG game. Inside the RPG game, there is a lot of "small games" as the game level.

Some small games themselves will have many different types, which must also contain repetition monsters in this.

This book is actually not to say that you will throw away the old game of "all", we just help you break away from the old mistake settings. All skill levels can still be reserved. Just from today's upgrade speed, it has changed to the original one hundred times.
