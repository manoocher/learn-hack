# Chapter 1 What is the key ability to improve learning?

Building Superman to learn this book is actually not very easy to write.

The reason is that "learning" itself is a very big issue. There are many factors that affect the outcome of this event.

So, when I was writing this book, although I could write a lot of material, but from which angle to cut into the arrangement order. It also gave me enough headaches.

The last edition that can be published is the result of rewriting it three or four times, and it is only after repeated adjustment that the most appropriate arrangement can be found.

## What exactly is learning? And why do we have a love-hate relationship with it?

"Learning" on the one hand is a skill that we use every minute of every day.

But when it comes to "learning", our feelings about it always come up with a mixed feeling.

We know that "learning" will ultimately benefit us. But on the one hand, we hate the process and the fact that the final result is very unstable by consuming time.

In the end, almost the vast majority of people chose the option of "escape".

This also leads to the act of "learning", although it takes up a large part of our lives. But relatively many people put very little effort into addressing the problem head-on in an organized manner.

Actually we don't want to. But talking about improving learning ability is sometimes like seeing a thick sticky wall. We tried our best to break through it. Either our fists were deeply sunk in it and we were embarrassed, or the wall seemed to sway, and we stood still.

Being stuck in the middle of the path we want to get to makes us both nauseated and exhausted.

### We confuse "natural learning" with "deliberate learning"

Why does this happen? I want to start by talking about what learning is.

According to the definition of Wikipedia, learning is divided into two types: narrow and broad:

- Narrow sense: The process of acquiring knowledge or skills through reading, listening, research, observation, understanding, exploration, experimentation, practice, etc. and sublimation) behavior. Such as the process of acquiring knowledge through schooling.
- In a broad sense: It is a relatively lasting behavioral pattern of behavior or behavioral potential generated by people in the process of life through experience.

Broadly speaking. We are "constantly downloading experience from the outside world" all the time, which is also called "natural learning". We humans are born with this ability. After watching the demonstration of others, I immediately found a way to imitate the operation. After a fall, I learned that there is a pothole on this road, so be careful next time you walk.

Such upgrade results allow us to have more certainty about various execution results. For the next time the same thing is performed, it can improve more efficiency. Not to mention the momentary joy when overcoming a problem.

So we actually love learning by nature.

But why do we hate learning again.

There are so many facts to complain about:

- Sometimes the experience of working in the A field is broken when I get the B field
- Sometimes I try my best and get nothing
- The process of taking the class is so painful, it's like being tortured by needles
- I wanted to solve a problem, but I was overwhelmed by the mountain of books.
- Something you spend a lot of time watching and then forget about in an instant
- ....

This list continues to expand, and it is no problem to write dozens of lines.

But the point is, why can we both love and hate the same thing?

Because, really want to say. This is actually two things.

- Like: what you like is the process and result of natural learning
- Hate: what you hate is the process and result of deliberate learning

The reason why we are thought to be the same thing. It is because our life has the ability to learn naturally. After a short free and happy learning period (ages 1-6). Was quickly pushed into a wrong hell learning environment (national education for 6-18 years old), and downloaded some plausible learning methods. And we are brainwashed by these messed up methods. Make the mistake of thinking that these methods are also the right way to learn. In the end, there is a result of mixing the methods and feelings of the two.

So in the end it was fun to learn "naturally", but painful to use these "learning methods" "deliberately".

So, we have mixed feelings about the issue of "learning". In fact, it is because in this field, the solutions, results, and emotions of two different "purposes" are confused. Not knowing when to use, what is right and what is wrong. Worse still, you feel like there is a Schr√∂dinger phenomenon, where both the process and the outcome are indeterminate.

Therefore, most people in society will even have PTSD (traumatic syndrome) for learning this word. When I heard these two words, I felt scared and subconsciously closed the way to "learning".

## Humans keep playing new games with the wrong strategy

If you discuss these two feelings separately, you will find that as a human being, the ability to learn naturally has not been destroyed. Because that is what we are born with. In our daily life, we are constantly modifying our previous behavior according to the result, and we have achieved the same result. This ability is "natural learning".

However, when it comes to "deliberate learning". It can be said that everyone is working very hard. As long as the problem is bigger, the process is painful and the result is crooked.

In theory, life can be happy if we don't touch the theme of "deliberate learning". This book can end here. (what)

But in reality, we cannot escape. This has been especially true in the past one or two hundred years. Before that, most human beings had been living a stable farming and hunting life, and the environment had not changed much. Therefore, even if the ability to "deliberate learning" is not enough, you can live a life with built-in "natural learning" alone.

But the world has changed dramatically in the past one or two hundred years. It only took 30 or 40 years from the time when personal computers became popular, when everyone could access the Internet, and now everyone uses mobile phones to complete various things. The speed of technological progress far exceeds the normal natural learning speed of human beings.

We humans have always adapted to the surrounding environment through continuous natural learning. However, the speed of change in the surrounding environment is so fast that if we do not go through a little "deliberate learning", we will even reach the attitude of being unable to survive, or even being eliminated soon. In serious cases, life may even be difficult (for example, mobile payment and QR code clearance)

Productivity in different fields is becoming more and more efficient in society with the aid of automatic tools. There are also more and more new methods and processes being invented.

Therefore, "deliberate learning" has become very important in keeping up with social changes.

This is why our society has created an "education system" that "deliberately trains" our ability to "deliberately practice".

But frankly, does this system help us overcome the changing times?

According to the final actual output, I think according to the evaluation and results of everyone in the society on the matter of "learning", I think it is "useless". Or even more harmful.

### The wrong model makes humans use the wrong strategy to solve problems, and even end up with the wrong mentality

In theory, our schools exist to increase the outcomes of students' "deliberate learning."

The reason for the establishment of the whole school education is to simulate a relatively safe environment, so that students can learn the knowledge and methods that will be used in the future society in this environment, so that the whole society can receive a batch of high-quality, learning methods, Adults who can keep up with social changes.

However, the idea is so. This is not the case with implementation results. It has even become a serious adverse effect.

how to say? I draw a table and you will know where the problem is.

Posting this form may shock readers instantly.

Digging, it seems that a new continent has been discovered.

In fact, just posting this picture, this book is written here, it seems to be able to call it a day. (what)

The reason why we have a deeply painful impression of learning. And I am very uncomfortable with the working life after graduating from school, feel that my ability is very low, and I have no ability to update since then. In fact, it's all because of the school.

In theory, schools are designed because we want the younger generation to have the ability to learn deliberately. In fact, they learn a set of wrong methods, thereby destroying their willingness and ability to learn.

This set of structures, from a macro perspective, essentially assumes a static and unchanging world, allowing participants to practice in it to get full marks on the test paper. And the pursuit of an average multi-angle development.

However, in the adult society, we are not faced with such an environment and challenge. The ability to survive in society is to quickly find ideas and develop solutions in the face of an unknown environment, and the measurement of achievement standards is overwhelmingly the pinnacle of a single subject.

School education covers 12-16 years before the essence of human beings. When young human beings enter this system, they are mostly blank sheets and still retain a certain level of learning ability. Our impressions of learning, methods, standards for comparing achievements, methods for setting goals, and design methods for solutions all come from schools.

But after so many years of training, many people do not feel that the "school" has prepared us after entering the society. Instead, I felt that what I had learned was useless for a moment.

After so many years of poisoning, many graduates have been blocked from even continuing to learn naturally, and believe that they have even lost their ability to update.

### Play the game with a new and correct mindset

I believe that readers of this book have played many different kinds of games. You should have a superficial knowledge of different kinds of games, and you should use different strategies to play and break levels.

For example, thinking that is used in turn-building cannot be used in real-time strategy. While the two games share some of the same individual building elements, the combination is essentially a fundamentally different type of game.

If you use the wrong game method, it is often difficult to clear the level, or even die early.

Study the field, too.

In the learning world, there are so many strange phenomena, in essence, it is because we have been playing the B game with the strategy of the A game! Then the game process is very tragic, the process is twice the result with half the effort, and there is no result in the end, which is naturally normal.

Back to the point of this chapter, so what is the key to improving motivation?

I think it is necessary to first realize that school simulation and social needs are actually two different games.

Once you realize what game you are in. It is already 50% successful.

Because human beings will naturally switch to different means of implementation because of different goals.

Therefore, when you can clearly realize that these are two different games and the rules of the game are completely different, you will naturally accept the new gameplay and even actively explore effective methods.

I think readers will struggle to read this book at first, if we are to learn new methods now. What about the old way?

do not worry,

- First of all, the method we learned in school is too broken and useless, and it is not a pity to throw it away
- Again, in fact, the methods I teach in this book are almost always old and natural to human beings. This book just teaches you the "correct" permutations and combinations, so that you can use the powerful power.

This book is a bit shocking and exhausting to read the first time you read it. But I assure you, as long as you spend two or three hours reading this book, you can absolutely start to have the effect I've claimed above, and it's an immediate change.

## RPG Game VS Memory Filling Game

So. How do we take the first step?

First, you already know that we're going to play a new game. That's enough to change a lot of things.

Second, our life is essentially an "RPG" game. You are just on the server Earth, playing yourself. We're playing a role-playing game, not a giant "fill in the blank memory game".

You might have thought it would be a shame to throw away the old ways.

But the new rules of the game are as follows:

- As long as you specialize in a project you like and are good at, you can get the highest score in the shortest time
- Any strange means can be used, and you can do anything that is not expressly prohibited by law
- The more proficient you are, the more exp will increase exponentially, the speed is 2 times that of others, and the return is 4 times that of others. The speed is 3 times that of others, and the return is 9 times that of others. And so on, the index type gives points.
- The standard of achievement is not a perfect copy to get 100 points and less points to be deducted. Instead, it encourages madness to try the next round, getting better and better, and madly stacking buffs to 10,000 points.
- High score brings money, fame and achievement

Looking back, will you find old gameplay and strategies:

- It is forbidden to overstudy the subjects you like, and you have to spend a lot of time learning "what you are not good at"
- Carry a bunch of stuff that you find boring. Do your best to recite 100 points.
- Don't make mistakes, try not to try new ones without deducting points

Is it really a pity to throw it away?

Third, also because this is an RPG game. In RPG games, there are many "mini-games" as game levels.

These mini-games themselves will have many different types, which must also include repeated beating monsters and filling in the blanks with memory.

This book isn't really about forcing you to throw away "everything" of the old ways, we're just trying to help you break free from the old mistakes of the past. All skill levels can still be retained. It's just that the upgrade speed from now on has become a hundred times as fast as before.
