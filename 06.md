# Chapter 6 The experience value that the genius master does not pass on is easy to increase the secret skill

Writing here, I think readers may feel that the amount of information is a bit huge for a moment.

After reading and writing notes, you may not be able to organize them.

Therefore, this chapter is mainly a buffer, let everyone take a break first, and help you sort out the sequence method from the first half of the book to the present.

1. List all the doubts you face in this field
2. Find the general direction you want to study, and organize a "pre-" learning map.
3. For these directions, find "short" and "quick" answers (it could be a teacher or a book)
4. Talk to these teachers or books, and learn how to do it first. (You can skip most of the content, focus on finding out how to do it, and ignore the rest)
5. After finding the method, try to find a way to practice at least 1-2 times in a short period of time (after class and within a week after reading the book).
6. Then find an opportunity to practice the next 3-5 times. Only this time you want to set the goal of being ten times stronger next time.
7. In order to find a ten times better solution, you will be more motivated to break down the whole process and understand the principle behind it, and repeat it several times to find the best parameters.
8. When you find these parameters. You may even find that the original traditional process is inefficient. In fact, there are more methods and technologies in modern times that can help you design a new process and achieve a hundred times the effect.
9. When your speed of progress begins to surpass ten, hundred, thousand, and ten thousand people, you will naturally reach the state of super-strong self-running.

The benefits of using this new process. mainly

- This process is in line with human "natural" learning habits
- is in line with brain science
- Each step is enough for you to complete and create a sense of certainty and achievement
- The path to learning a field can be very short
- Not easy to go crooked
- You can calculate the cost and time required for learning before you start learning again
- After a few practice, you can win a bunch of people and be called a genius

In the process, you don't even need to memorize things on purpose. It's just a matter of demolition of questions and answers. Naturally, high efficiency results and an amazing amount of knowledge can be obtained.

It doesn't even feel hard at all.

### Play and become a master

The methods we have described so far may surprise readers and completely subvert their own impressions of learning.

Because, our former impression is that if we want to become a master. It has to be "deliberately practiced". And our imagination of deliberate practice is even associated with:

> Alone in the mountains, gritted his teeth to practice basic skills, squatted every day, practiced diligently for more than ten years, and finally came out of the mountain to become a master.

Therefore, many people want to become masters in their hearts. But do you really have to squat and practice hard for ten years?

But although so many people want to become masters. But very few people personally interviewed how the master himself became so powerful in the end.

However, if someone really went to interview the master. You may not believe the answer given by the master himself: "Goose, it is very fun, and it has become like this after playing for decades."

If you don't believe it, you can read the biographies of many masters. Everyone will tell you this shit.

Before I became a domain master, I thought that these masters were all hiding their tricks and talking nonsense. Until I also became a master, others thought that I was talking shit.

But at the end of the day, geniuses or masters in many fields. It is true that it has been practiced thousands or even tens of thousands of times. It's just that this practice is very different from what most people imagine. It is not "hard practice" but "easy practice".

### The master himself is a playful "addict"

In my book "Building a Superhuman Brain," I touched on the subject of habits and addictions a little bit.

The vast majority of human behaviors are formed by stacking large and small "habits".

"Habits" are decisions and actions made "in the past", re-screened. (In fact, it is to repeat the "procedural knowledge")

Why do the bottom layers of human behavior depend on "habits"? This is because if everything, regardless of size, needs to access the brain's memory and call the brain for decision-making and judgment, the brain will not be busy at all.

And muscle access to knowledge, access is not consuming energy. This is the so-called subconscious.

Regarding the creation of "habits", the cognitive psychology community has concluded a formula:

> Habit = Trigger -> Routine -> Reward

Later, when I was researching the field of games, I found a surprising coincidence:

> Addict = Trigger -> Action -> Dynamic Reward。

That is, "habit" and "addiction" are essentially the same structure.

It's just that addiction is better than "habit", and the final reward is "change".

Humans don't know whether the final reward is big or small, so they will keep trying. Trigger the continuous secretion of dopamine.

It leads to addicts who can't stop at all.

So if you observe ancient and modern masters, almost all of them are seriously abnormal addicts in terms of their knowledge and skills.

Just because they have created great achievements, and the world does not know how these amazing skills are stacked, it can only be assumed that they are "suffering".

## **Talking about Flow and Addiction**

I believe you should have heard these two terms "flow" and "addiction".

Let's see what the definition of "flow" is:

> "Flow" refers to the state of engrossment and ecstasy when we do something. In this state, the existence of time is not even felt. And when this is done, we have a feeling of energy and great satisfaction.

**Flow in the learning world is often referred to as a positive word**. It means that the learner enters a state of forgetfulness and learns rapidly.

And let's look at the definition of "addiction" again:

> "Addiction" refers to an extraordinary hobby and habit of a person, which is formed by stimulating the reward system of the central nervous system to cause excitement or pleasure "addiction". As for "addiction", it refers to the individual's uncontrollable and repeated desire to abuse a certain substance or engage in a certain activity, although he knows that doing so will ** bring him or has brought various adverse consequences to himself, but still cannot control**.

Addiction is often referred to as a negative word in the learning world. Refers to the student indulging in one of the skills, causing the other skills to be wasted.

But these two nouns are in science. Essentially the same thing. They are all caught in the reward and stimulation system cycle of the central nervous system, and they will fall into the spiritual time house.

About "flow". Hungarian scholar, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, once wrote a book "Flow: The Optimal Psychology of Experience that Experts Are Studying".

The word "optimal experience psychology that experts are studying" is really a high evaluation.

But why do parents see the addiction of "children" as beasts? I think this is due to the difference in goal setting.

### Different goals, different strategies. Talk about the game of <<\*\*Chinese-style parents>>

In 2018, there was a new game "Chinese Parents" on Steam, which became very popular instantly after its launch.

![](images/20211023162302.png)

The purpose of the game is to let you play as a parent, educate your children, and finally achieve "success in the game".

Every player will be very shocked when they play this game for the first time.

Almost all adults in society essentially hate their K-12 education time. What's more, I hate my parents, who have been strict with me since I was a child, always interrupt my hobbies and interests, and require the average development of subjects, and also require Keke to be 100%. It made our childhood miserable.

When I first started playing this game, I also wanted to make good use of my educational philosophy to cultivate my "children" in the game. Study happily and only study subjects that interest him.

As a result, I was also intimidated by my own in-game behavior.

Because, contrary to what I hoped, I was subconsciously constantly scoring points in this game, and compared with other parents, I hoped that my children would have excellent and high scores in Keke.

When the game was over (the 18-year-old college entrance examination distribution), I was terrified...

What did I just do in the game. Isn't it fun to study? Respect the child's development, is the development partial?

It turned out that the parents I hated when I was a teenager were no different.

After the game was over, I thought back to why I was behaving irrationally.

It turned out to be affected by the purpose of the game.

The final game of this game (suspected) is getting into a good university.

When you see a child you cultivated, who did not get admitted to Peking University and Tsinghua University, and whose scores are not very high, you will feel disappointed and even wonder which step you have made wrong.

The learning outcomes in the game are all quantified digital abilities.

In order to be admitted to the top Peking University, Tsinghua University, you will go crazy and want to complete the five average subject abilities, Keke, and rush to the highest score.

It seems that the score of one subject is lower than that of other subjects, which is "abnormal".

We hate everything our parents did to us as children. But in the end, when we treat the characters in the game, we are so ruthless in scoring points and hours.

Moreover, even in the New Year's PK mini-game in the game, like fighting Pokémon, if you want to fight with relatives' children, you must brush until you win.

The emotional tsunami caused by this game was too intense, so after the game was launched, it gained a huge reputation in the Chinese area.

The most interesting thing about this game is that there is an English version of the game, but European and American players say they can't understand the gameplay of average brushing. I also think it's morbid to treat a child as a Pokémon-like brush value battle event.

Only after playing this game did I understand why parents in this society are very disgusted with "addiction".

Because of the "addiction bias" this would undermine the best strategy based on the original game's purpose of "admission to a prestigious school": average high scores.

But does being admitted to a prestigious school mean that you will be successful in society? Not necessarily, or even quite the opposite.

Because what the adult world needs is not average people, but professional experts.

Let's go back to the comparison chart of school education and adult education mentioned in Chapter 1

This explains why in society, those great gods, craftsmen, and masters are all addicted demons who are partial to science and even drop out of school. But the academic bullies in the school are often just "ordinary people" in the end.

"Flow" and "addiction" are essentially the same thing.

However, because flow accelerates students' learning and achieves rapid learning effects, it is called the Holy Grail state of learning. And students are addicted to a certain video game or subject, resulting in all the time wasted on the meaningless output of the final results (such as: admission to a famous school, exams) that parents consider, so it is regarded as academic waste. Prime culprit.

"Addiction" is finally stigmatized.

### Why we end up being "average people"

The effect of spontaneous braking on "favorite subjects" and "addictions". It's not that simple.

When I was teaching programming, I met several students who were good at learning. But it is very strange, they are obviously very smart, but in the end they seem to be stuck. After my in-depth inquiries, I found that they thought programming was really fun, and they thought the courses I arranged were very enjoyable, but they were terrified (and couldn't tell) about learning "programming" but ending up being "addicted". s reason). So when you find yourself with signs of addiction burning time, stop abruptly.

An American internet celebrity "Bi Jinghan" that I have been following on Facebook for a long time in Taiwan also mentioned something similar. In the eight to nine years he has been a teacher in Taiwan, he has probably asked more than one to two thousand people, "What do you like to eat? What do you dislike to eat?", and then he found that -- -- -- the vast majority of people in Taiwan really can't tell What you like to eat, what you don't like to eat.

This later became his little game. Every time he met a new student, he would spend 5 minutes and force the students to say what they like to eat.

As a result, he found that most Taiwanese can really eat anything, even if they don't like it, under the pressure of mother/grandmother/teacher/boyfriend, they can't insist on not eating. My TASTE was crushed to death by my elders, so I am really at a loss when asked by him now, because I don't know what I like or not!

When we look back at our own 15-18-year-old youth, we are all amazed by our IQ, reserve knowledge, and resilience. Able to use complex English and mathematics, and have infinite patience to try the subjects you like.

I still remember when I was 15 years old, I installed the wrong settings because I didn't understand the principles of Linux. I can sit there in an endless loop and reload dozens of times a day, and then stop when I'm done. At the age of 12, in order to modify the values ​​in video games, he pestered his father to ask what hexadecimal was. In order to learn to change the code, I took a thick dictionary and desperately looked up the English words on the web page, trying my best to understand the meaning of the article (there was no Google translation at that time).

Why don't we do this when we grow up? Even subconsciously fear to pursue and immerse themselves in the knowledge they like.

This is because what K-12 education tells you is that pursuing the subjects of interest you want and betting heavily on them will be suppressed and threatened to survive (parents will throw away the things you like and say no to you Read and get out of the house.)

In the end, you don't have anything you like, and you don't have anything you hate.

And you dare not like to "explore" and "immerse" in something you like, because your subconscious tells you that it will threaten your own survival.

Therefore, after countless people left the school, they became an average person.

As human beings, we have an automatic upgrade mechanism (for the skills we like, we can practice more and more quickly, and we can also open the mental time house mode). It's just that this education system is forced to turn off.

Create a superhuman learning book, to put it bluntly, without trying to teach you any new learning methods. Just getting rid of the spiritual pollution of school education and going back to the most primitive way of learning for human beings can make you progress by leaps and bounds.
