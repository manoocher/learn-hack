# Chapter 6: The experience value that the genius master does not pass on is easy to increase the secret skill

Writing here, I think the readers may feel a bit huge between the information.

After reading a note, you may not be finished.

So this chapter is mainly a buffer, let everyone rest in the middle of the field, help everyone to organize the current order in the present book to now.

1. List themselves face all the doubts in this field
2. Find the direction of roughly want to study, and organize a "pre-" learning map.
3. For these directions, find "short" and "fast" solution (can be a teacher, can also be a book)
4. With these teachers or books, learn the practice. (You can skip most content, focus on finding the practice, the rest does not need to be
5. After finding the practice, in a short period of time (after the class, after reading the book for one week) I want to find a chance to practice at least 1-2 times.
6. Then find the opportunity to practice follow-up 3-5 times. Just this time you have to set the target ten times in the next one.
7. In order to find a big answer, you will make more motivation, go to the whole process, and go deep into the principle behind, and make more anti-a few times, find the best parameters.
8. When you find these parameters. You will even find that the original traditional process is inefficient. In fact, there are more methods and technology to help you design a new process and reach a hundred times.
9. When your progress is beginning to win ten people, 100 people, thousand people, when you have a realm of superior operation.

Use this new process benefit. Mainly

- This process is in line with human "nature" learning habits
- is in line with brain
- Every step is enough to let you finish, and create a sense of confirmation, accomplishment
- Learning a path of a field can become very short
- Not easy to walk
- Calculate the cost of learning, time before you can learn
- You can win a bunch of people, being called genius.

In this process, you don't even need to deliberate. Only need to keep the demolition problem and get together. Naturally you can get high efficiency results and amazing knowledge.

I will not feel hard even at all.

### Playing with a master

What we have so far, may make readers very surprised, completely subverting yourself for learning.

Because, our previous impression is that if we want to become a master. "Deliberately practice" must be obtained. And we think about the imagination of deliberate practice, even Lenovo:

> A person is alone in the mountains, biting the basics of the tooth, and squatting in the sky every day.

So, although many people are thinking of masters. But is it really going to practice ten years?

But although so many people want to become master. Few people personally go to the interview with the master, I am so powerful.

However, if someone is going to interview master. The answer you will answer, you may not believe in: "Goose, it is very fun, it will become this in a row for decades."

If you don't believe, you can see the life of many masters. Everyone will tell you this kind of dry.

Before I haven't become a master of the field, I originally thought that these masters were hidden, and they didn't have any mouth. Until I became a master, others also thought that I was talking about it.

But in the end, the genius or master of many fields. Behind it has passed thousands of or even tens of thousands of times. Just this practice, it is very different from the average person, not "hard practice" but "easily practice."

### The master itself is a "addiction" gentleman who loves to play.

I have a slight mention of the theme of habits and addiction in "Building Super People's Brain"

The vast majority of human beings is a "habit" stack by large and small.

"Customs" is the decision and action that "past" has been reflected. (In fact, it is repeated "programmatic knowledge")

Why is the underlying behavior of human beings? This is if you need to access your brain memory because of everything, if you call the brain decision, the brain is not coming.

And the knowledge of muscles, access is not costly. That is, the so-called understanding.

About building "habits", cognitive psychology community summarized a formula:

> Habit = Trigger -> Routine -> Reward

Later, when I was studying the field of the game, I found an amazing coincidence:

> Addict = trigger -> action -> Dynamic Reward.

That is, "habits" is the same as "addictive" in nature.

Just addictive than "habits", the final reward is "changing".

Humans don't know that the final reward is big and small, so they will try it. Trigger dopamine keeps secretion.

Leading addicts, can't stop.

So you observe an ancient and modern masters, almost one of their understanding and skills, is a severe abnormal addict.

Just because they have created great achievements, and the world does not know how these amazing skills are stacked, so they can only be practiced by "bitterness".

## ** Talk about the heart and addictive **

I believe that you should have heard these two nouns "heart" and "addictive".

Let's take a look at the definition of "heartflow":

> "Heart" means that when we are doing something, the whole god is concentrated, and the state of being forgotten. In this state, even if it doesn't feel the existence of time. And after this thing is completed, we will have an energy and very satisfied feel.

** Heart flow in the learning industry, often refers to a positive word **. Refers to the learner to enter a state in which I have forgotten it, quickly study.

Let's take a look at "Addic" definition:

> Addicts "refers to an unusual hobbies and habits that people produce some kind of thing, this hobbies and habits are formed by stimulating the central nervous reward system (Reward system) As for "addiction", it refers to an individual's non-self-made anti-thirst for abuse of some substance or engaged in some kind of activity. Although I know that I will bring all kinds of bad consequences to myself, but still can't control\*\*.

Addiction in the learning world, often refers to a negative word. Refers to a student to add one of the skills, causing other skills being ruined.

But these two nouns are scientifically. Essentially is the same thing. They are all fell into the central nervous reward stimulus system cycle, and they will fall into the spiritual time house.

About "Heart Flow". Hungarian scholar, Mihali CSIkszentmihaly, has written a book "Heartflow: The master is studying the best experience psychology".

"The master's excellent experience psychology" is really high.

But why do parents see the addiction of "child", think it is like a flood beast? I think this is due to the difference between the target setting.

### The target is different, the strategy will be different. Talk << ** Chinese Parents >> This game **

In 2018, there is a new game "Chinese Parents" on Steam. After the game is launched, it will become very hot.

! [] (iMages / 20211023162302.png)

The purpose of the game is to let you play a parent, educate your own children, and finally get "success in the game."

Every player, just when you play this game, you will be very shocked.

Almost all adults in the society, essentially hate their own K-12 education time. Especially, hate your parents, from small to yourself, I always interrupt my intellectual interest, ask the average development of the discipline, and also ask Kokko a hundred points. Do our childhood pain.

I just started playing this game, I also want to use my own education concept, and cultivate my "child" in the game. Happy learning, just learn the subject of interest.

As a result, I was also scared by myself in the game.

Because, in contrast to I hope, I will consciously put it in this game, compare with other parents, I hope my children's Kobo excellent high score.

When the game ends (18-year-old high school entrance examination), I was scared ...

I just did what I did in the game. Don't you say good happiness? Respect the child's development and development

It turned out that my parents in the teenageths of my hate didn't have anything.

After the game is over, I recalled why I have this inert behavior.

It turns out that it is affected by the purpose of the game.

The final game of this game (suspected) wins is a good university.

When you see your own children, I have not admitted to the Northern Tsinghua, the score is not very high, you will be lost, and even which step is wrong.

The learning results in the game are all quantified digital capabilities.

In order to admit the highest Northern Tsinghua, you will go crazy, you want to brush the five average disciplines and Kobo, rush to the highest point.

It seems like a score of a department, which is less than other disciplines, is "abnormal".

We hate all parents do everything in childhood. But in the end, we actually brush the number of brushes and brushing in the role of the game.

Moreover, even in the New Year PK game in the game, like a magical baby, you want to fight with your relatives, you must brush to victory.

The emotional tsunami triggered by this game is too violent, so after the game is launched, it has achieved huge sense of communication in the Chinese area.

The most interesting thing this game is that this game has English, but European and American players said that they could not understand the average gameplay. I still feel that the child is very sick to the battle game when making a magical baby.

I have played this game to understand why the parents in this society have a very disgusted on "addiction".

Because "addictive pavilion" will destroy the best strategy based on the original game's "test name": the average score of the brush.

But is the famous school say that can be famous in society? Not necessarily, even completely opposite.

Because the adult world needs is not an average person, it is a professional skill.

Let's look back in the first chapter of the school education and adult education comparison

This explains why the society, the gods, craftsmen, people, all of which are deserialized or even dropped out of school. In the school, the school, but it is often just "ordinary people".

"Heart" and "Addiction" are essentially the same thing.

However, because the heart is accelerating, it has accelerated the student, and the speed of learning is achieved, and it is called the realm of the study of the Holy Cup. Students have made all the time consumption of the final achievements (such as: examination of famous schools, exam test), which are deemed to be trained in the waste of parents. Prime Culprit.

"Addiction" is finally laminated.

### Why we finally became a "average"

The effects of spontaneous brakes on "liked" "addictive". Not so simple.

When I was teaching programming, I have a few student having a good learning ability. But very strange, they are very smart, but in the end, it seems to be able to calm down. After I asked in depth, I found that the programming is really fun, but also feels very fun, but they are very fearful for learning "Programming", "addicted", but also can't say it. S REASON. So it is obey when you find some signs of addiction feeding.

A long-term tracked American Net (Bijing Han "I have tracked on Facebook in Taiwan also mentioned something similar. He has already asked more than two thousand people in Taiwan. "What do you like? What do you like?" I love what I have, don't love what.

This later turned his little game. Every time I met a new student, I took a 5-minute walk, I forced the students to say what I liked.

As a result, he found that most Taiwanese really can eat anything, even if you don't like it, you can't persist in your mother / Aunt / Teacher / men and women, it may not be able to persist, there may be some ideas, but later Your own Taste was died by the elders, so now he asked, I really don't know what it is, because I like it, I don't know!

When we look back to see our own 15-18-year-old youth, we have never been ignored at the time, reserve knowledge, and toughness. Ability to use complex English and mathematics, there is an infinite tolerance cycle to try to have an infinite tolerance.

I still remember that I was 15 years old, because I didn't understand Linux principle, I set it wrong. I can sit in the unlimited circulation in the unlimited circulation, I will get it. 12 years old in order to modify the value inside the electric game, wrapped his father asked 16. In order to learn the retroform code, I took a thick rhetoric to check the English song on the web page. I don't want to understand the meaning of the article (there is no Google translation).

Why are we growing up, but don't do this? Even the consciousness is pursuing and immersed in your favorite learning.

This is because K-12 education tells you that pursuing the disciplines you want, and highly betting, it will be suppressed, will be thrown (parents will throw away what you like, don't tell you Read the book rolled out.)

Finally, you don't have something you like, you don't have anything hate.

And you can't like "exploration" and "immersion" in a favorite thing, because the subconscious tells you, it will threaten yourself.

Therefore, after countless people have made a average person.

As a human, it has a set of automatic upgrade mechanisms (for the skills that you like, you can get more familiar, more and more practice, and also open the spiritual time house mode). Just is turned off by this educational system.

Building a superman learning this book, saying that wearing does not want to teach you what new learning method. Light is a mental pollution of school education. If you go back to the most original way of learning, you will make you fly.
