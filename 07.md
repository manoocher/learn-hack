# Chapter 7 Flow Learning Method "Motivation Disassembly"

When adults talk about learning, they mostly talk about effects:

- Fluent as a pro
- Exam 100 points
- outpace others
- find a job
- Using skills to achieve the results I envisioned

And they must be achieved in a short period of time.

I believe that everyone enjoys the feeling of "being a god" and "winning".

I am also very tired of the old-fashioned education that reads a lot of small knowledge, but has no results at all.

### How to become addicted while teaching yourself

We mentioned "self-learning" again, which is essentially "self-teaching". It also mentioned the occupation of adults, which is a competition for the "efficiency of procedural knowledge". There is also "conceptual knowledge, meta-knowledge access proficiency".

So in essence, to learn a skill quickly is to become addicted to practicing the skill, and you will become a master if you keep practicing it.

But again, you wonder, how is this possible?

Practice, it's not very painful. How can you be addicted?

When I was a programmer, I was actually addicted to programming. But when I study other subjects, I don't necessarily get into this state every time.

So I am also thinking about how to artificially create a framework that can enter the flow of the heart, for myself, and can also be copied for others to use.

### Mining the key to flow and addiction from the game

In 2017, in order to create a large-scale online programming class "full stack camp" with high success rate. Very troubled by this issue.

How can people who have never been exposed to programming become addicted to learning programming?

But I couldn't find the starter brick at first. I found out later that this is because there is very little literature on student addiction in education. Because "addiction" is a negative word in education. Refers to deviating from the main track to indulge in wasting time.

If games are mentioned, most of them are talking about how to intersperse interactive games to improve short-term concentration between classes. But what I want is not a short-acting focus drug, but a long-acting focus drug.

I thought about it later, why not switch fields and go directly to the field of game design to look for it?

To me a "course" or a "game" is a "shortened version of the real world".

But game designers have a very positive attitude towards "addiction". After all, one of the purposes of game design is to make players addicted and unable to extricate themselves.

Also a shortened version of the real world. Wouldn't people be curious about why games can take away students' concentration so much?

So I spent a lot of time researching these four themes, "habit", "flow", "addiction", and "gamification", hoping to find the key to the design.

### Flow

The Hungarian psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi mentioned in the book "Flow: The Optimal Psychology of Experience that Experts Are Studying" that there are five elements to enter a state of flow:

**(1) Clear goals**

To achieve the flow experience, we first need to do something with a clear goal, because the goal will lead to focus and allow us to devote ourselves to it.

**(2) Instant feedback**

Immediate feedback is a key point to achieve flow, why many people are addicted to games or gambling, that is, games and gambling have instant feedback, how well done, you can see the effect immediately.

**(3) Difficulty Matching**

Difficulty matching is the level being challenged today, in line with the challenger's current level. No difficulty will get bored quickly, but if the difficulty is too high, it is easy to give up. Therefore, the appropriate difficulty will arouse the continuous investment of the participants.

**(4) Full concentration**

Cutting out potential outside distractions will allow you to enter a state of flow faster and less likely to be interrupted.

**(5) Continuous challenge**

Not only matching the difficulty, but providing it consistently to keep the activity challenging is at the heart of deliberate practice. Only in this way can you be in a state of full-hearted flow for a long time.

### Addicted

In the learning world, flow is often referred to as a positive word. It means that the learner enters a state of forgetfulness and learns rapidly.

Addiction is a symptom similar to flow, but it is a negative term in the learning world.

> "Addiction" (Addiction) refers to a person's extraordinary hobby and habit of something, which is formed by stimulating the reward system of the central nervous system to cause excitement or pleasure "addiction". As for "addiction", it refers to the individual's uncontrollable and repeated craving to abuse a certain substance or engage in a certain activity, although he knows that doing so will bring him or has brought him various adverse consequences, but still cannot control it.

Parents abandon their studies because their children are addicted to playing games. So parents often see students addicted to a certain thing. Students are forced to quit.

But in science. Essentially they are the same thing. They are all caught in the reward and stimulation system cycle of the central nervous system, and they will fall into the spiritual time house.

Since flow is addiction.

So how do we create a flow/addiction state. From the book "Flow of Heart":

- (1) Clear goals
- (2) Instant feedback
- (3) Difficulty matching
- (4) Full concentration
- (5) Continuous challenge

From my practical experience, I think this should just be the "representative element" of "flow". Not really a process.

Behaviourist Nir Eyal has a book called Hooked. which describes how human addiction is artificially created

> HOOKED = TRIGGER -> ACTION -> REWARD -> INVESTMENT -> INVESTMENT

Start a fire, provoke it, and then provide a solution. After the user is rewarded, it promotes certain behaviors. Reuse this behavior to create the next trigger point to achieve the result of building the next loop.

"Clear goals", "Instant feedback" and "Difficulty matching" are to keep humans in a stable fixed behavior + reward loop, while "continuous challenge" is the cycle result of this behavior, and "concentration" is the psychological state of the participants .

So what is "addiction" in essence?

Addiction = "Smooth Fixed Behavior" + "Reward System".

Further, this "stable fixed behavior" is "habit". Addiction = "habit" + "reward system".

You can think carefully about what "challenges" are in mobile games. After we deconstruct the game and remove the game plot, you will find that your hands are just sliding around. What you're really looking forward to is "the one with different contents" and the "reward chest".

As we mentioned in the previous chapters, narrative memory is easily forgotten by humans. And repetitive procedural memory (repetitive practice) is automatically remembered by the human body.

But no one is very boring to practice a movement dozens of times over and over again. This is so boring. But HOOK to the reward system is different.

Correct reward design. No matter how boring the action is, you can probably brush it all night. Think about those times when you stayed up late playing video games.

### Habit

So what is a habit?

Habits are patterns of behavior that the brain automatically follows. Our daily life is faced with hundreds of choices from the moment we open our eyes. Whether to brush your teeth or not, what clothes to wear, what shoes to wear, what route to take to work, and what to drink to refresh yourself at work.

There is no need to make a choice.

But if the brain needs to judge everything it encounters in life, it has to make a judgment before it can act. Then your brain freezes before you even step out of the house.

Therefore, our brain will establish the memory trajectory that has been made in the past, and the experience is OK, and become a "routine behavior", which is called "habit".

Habits have several characteristics:

- Simple actions
- repetitive actions
- Immediate positive feedback
- Smooth and brisk emotional feedback (small luck)

In the course design class of American master Bob Pike, I learned a sharp angle of design course:

Do the course to segment the importance of modules. Try to keep each chapter to 15 minutes or less (physical lessons).

There are several main reasons:

- 15 minutes is the optimal length to maintain focus
- 15 minutes is also the best length to retain learning content
- Divided into small modules, the difficulty is easy to control and adjust
- The course structure is also easy to clip, adjust back and forth

Short and simple courses can be very easy to implant "habit design".

Because it is impossible for teachers to let students develop "habits" through a complex interactive mechanism and emotional experience.

Many people often mistakenly think that gamification is all about porting elements of gamification into the curriculum.

It's just to understand what it means literally. But gamifying the curriculum is not about adding game elements to the curriculum.

Because a game not only has game elements, it can be fun. Otherwise, there wouldn't be so many bad games on Steam.

For a long course that can be addictive, the design focus should be on how to count the content you want to teach into a routine (fixed action) that is targeted, repetitive and easy to learn.

Then add "rewards" and "gamification elements" (motivational elements), so that students "have the motivation to enter the loop" "can perceive their own growth" and finally "do not feel that they seek the next round of repetition to get different forms of rewards".

heard here. Readers may still feel that this should be just an assumption, how can it be possible to put boring knowledge. Packed into a fun game.

Next, I'll actually tear down a popular game and let everyone know how they did it. This game can even turn the boring and simple house building game into a package that has caught the attention of players for a month.

## Dismantling the design secrets of the most popular game "Animal Crossing" in 2020

End of March 2020. Because of the ravages of COVID-19. Staying at home is so boring. At that time, Nintendo had just launched a new game "Animal Crossing". We all know how popular this game was at the time. The screenshots of the game are almost full of the entire FB. Can't buy.

So I also went to pre-order one. Unexpectedly, this essentially stupid game caught my sister and I's attention for a whole month.

This game is essentially just a simple game of catching bugs, fishing, and decorating. The two of us were stuck in it and couldn't help ourselves. In the end, it even caused us to buy three NDSs (one for each person, and one more to be turned on after the whole day, as an island for producing raw materials).

So I was curious, what kind of routine and motivation is used in Nintendo's game, which can hook the player's soul.

**Inexplicably addicting players around the world**

Animal Crossing is a very mysterious game.

It's normal for me to be addicted to games, but my sister's addiction to games is not normal. Because of the many fun games, it takes time and is too complicated for him.

In the end, he became more addicted to this game than I was.

I originally bought this game. On the day it arrived, my sister saw that I was playing and felt that this game was quite simple and mentally retarded, and I was sleepy after playing for a while and wanted to take a nap. So let him take over.

Originally, he was just pulling weeds and fishing. Unexpectedly, when I woke up, the situation changed. Because my sister thought pulling weeds and fishing was too much fun, so he played with all the fish that could be pulled and caught on the whole island.

And, not even willing to return my game console.

Because Nintendo didn't have a mechanism to transfer game records at the time, my Nintendo had to become his. I will buy a new one.

For the next month, my sister even stayed with the game console. Sometimes I even open two Switches at a time to farm. It's not just my sister who has this symptom. Almost a lot of my friends on my FB wall have fallen.

Everyone described this game as having magic: "This game originally thought it was quite mentally retarded. It was just cleaning an island and fishing. I didn't know why I fell into it, and I got up on time every day to help the black heart raccoon to work."

What kind of magic does Blackheart Fox have? Why is this game that seems to be mentally retarded and exploits players to work for free to pay black salary mortgages, so that players are addicted to the point of being unable to extricate themselves.

This is the focus of our next analysis of perspective.

### **Game Dynamics (Octagonal Frame)**

Before getting started, I would like to recommend a book whose dynamic framework runs through the main structure of the following chapters.

This book is the book Actionable Gaminification.

In this book, the author, Mr. Zhou Yukai, summed up a human dynamic framework "Octagon Theory".

Human motivation to do something can basically be divided into eight categories.

![](images/20211023162925.png)

If the octagon is divided into upper and lower areas. The top is the bright area of ​​the front of the white hat, and the bottom is the dark area of ​​the black hat.

- The white hat is the motivational element that makes humans feel strong, fulfilled, and satisfied.
- And the black hat underneath is the element that makes humans feel fascinated, anxious, and addicted.

Generally speaking:

- The driving force of black hats is stronger in the short term. For example, being chased by fear or asking you to act immediately, you will jump up and chase immediately when you see a prize, but you will not feel it after a long time.
- The driving force of a white hat may not feel in the short term, but in the long term it will make you feel that you are accomplishing great things and can be satisfied for a long time.

If we split the octagon into left and right sides.

- The elements on the left are more outwardly motivated, compared to their surroundings.
- The elements on the right are more intrinsically motivated, driven from the heart.

Animal Crossing has used simple elements to grasp the dynamic elements inside very well. Therefore, this essentially "naive and boring" game has made many players seriously addicted, but they can't stop playing in the end.

## Dismantling Dongsen routines (the first five days)

Dongsen's games really need to be analyzed, and you can analyze the progress of the game in the first five days and the last five days.

The first five days of the game will be more like onboarding of a game, which is a process of teaching players to learn the game.

Why five days? In fact, when we design websites or games, 5 is a very critical number.

If you can let the user use it 5 times in a row. Basically, he will develop an inertia in the follow-up. Not easy to drop this game.

So the first five days of Dongsen are actually very critical.

### Day 1: Rick tricks you into signing a mortgage

On the first day of playing Dongsen. There are actually no tasks in Dongsen. But at the end of the day, Rick wickedly tricked the player into signing a 9800 mortgage.

Why did raccoon trick users into signing mortgages?

This is to make the user mistakenly think that he has a goal in the first place. It's that he owes money that needs to be paid back.

Otherwise, if you only come to the island to cut trees and fish, the user will immediately feel that this is a stupid game and leave immediately.

Of course, what you can play on the first day is also limited. Li Ke gave the player a tent and told the player to go home to wash and sleep, and come back to him tomorrow.

Therefore, although there is no content on the first day, players will still be willing to take it as "Okay. I can accept being cheated for one day, and see what you have to say tomorrow."

### DAY 2: MAKE THE TASK MEANING

When the player went to Tanuki the next day, he said that he had a friend who was coming to live on the island, and also told the player that he was willing to buy fossils for 500. Because the player is very short of money at this time, and the weeds are not so profitable, of course the player wants to say that this should be a bit interesting.

Otherwise, who would have to pull weeds, fish, and dig fossils every day for free?

After the raccoon had filled up the quota, he started to make excuses to confuse the players, saying that he was helping the curator find the museum location. It will be covered the next day.

Although players feel as if the game is boring. But he has promised to help people build a museum. I want to stay for a day to see what else Tanuki can come up with.

### Day 3: The museum opened, it turned out to be able to collect things

After the museum curator came. Found out that there was suddenly something new to play. is to collect. (Ownership Dynamics)

The average player has a cheap mentality. When they see the collection book, they will want to collect the whole collection.

So the player will start to be very busy. Fishing for bugs everywhere.

At first I thought this game was very mentally retarded, but suddenly I felt not mentally retarded. Still wondering where to catch more.

This is where the airport and mileage rolls come in handy.

The mileage threshold will also be just enough for players to leave the island once.

A little design here is that each tree can be cut three times. Why cut it three times?

Because three different things may be dropped. This makes the player feel "not sure what to drop" and will keep slashing and slashing.

Fishing is the same principle. My sister likes fishing more than catching bugs. Because he enjoyed the feeling of being able to catch a mysterious big fish.

And I was also obsessed with it, in order to catch more fish. I actually bought an extra Switch Lite to use as a public southern hemisphere at home for fishing.

### Day 4: Going out to make friends

When players can leave the island, they will start to find strange characters. He will want to come and move to your island.

To help new players build houses. I will realize that the materials I have stockpiled a few days ago are really not enough.... I have to continue to chop wood.

And after these new characters, they often do some mysterious behavior. For example, tease you, tease you, give you something.

Such novelty (uncertainty) will tempt the player to talk and interact with them all the time.

At the same time, because the player began to find very strange fish, very strange neighbors. Start uploading pictures to FB.

At this time, a bunch of people will ask you what this is, and your vanity is simply bursting to the extreme (social influence).

Players will feel that my family has Dongsen and I am honored.

### DAY 5: BUILD YOUR OWN HOME

A few days ago, in fact, there was no fun at home in the light and convex at all. But after waiting for the player to deceive three islanders. There are some furniture to choose from at home. Players will want to start building a little and try it out.

Then these furniture are very machine thieves need iron ore. So the player had no choice but to go to the farm to exchange coupons and go out to the island to mine.

So far, players have been playing for five days without knowing it.

At this time, you feel that you are poor, and you are very discouraged. Do I want to be a farmer for a lifetime?

### Day 6: The dawn is coming, the rutabaga guy appears

Just when you feel discouraged in life, suddenly a guy who sells kohlrabi comes along. As a result, this guy secretly told you a secret trick to make money, that is, you can get rich by frying rutabaga futures.

So you dubiously put your money all in to buy his food.

What followed was a dreadful day. At this time, the player has unknowingly become the slave of Dongsenli's money (money power).

Because kohlrabi will be rotten on weekends. So the player must sell the vegetables in these six days. Vegetable prices will be reported three times a day. So it forces the player to come back three times a day. . . . . . . (fear of losing motivation)

Is there any smell of that evil in the beginning... . . .

I had to give up playing this thief game and tied the player for a week.

### Day 7: It is said that KK is coming

But the seventh day was really nothing to do. Looking for something to do. At this time, Tanuki said that he wanted to let his idol KK go to the island.

At this time, you are wondering who KK is?

But no matter who. Anyway, the island has to be built to a certain level before he will come.

Anyway, the player has nothing to do, so he starts to cover. (Actually, it's none of my business who KK is)

Then cover it up, and Xi Shihui from the town hall thinks that you lack this and that. You have to keep collecting flowers and decorations.

Inexplicably, the cover also began to cover the island into a little shape.

Human beings just want to cover up and finish up. At this time, Rick will sell the player to build the bridge and Agai slope.

As the owner of the island, this must be your business. (achievement, mission, creation)

If you look at the grass mud horse, a basic building, the cheapest is 98,000. Just keep working to make money.

And to here. Almost all players have become inertial. It is not possible to quit at this time.

## Restriction mechanism (do not let players play "exhausted" games, resulting in giving up halfway)

There are several detailed balancing mechanisms here. Prevent players from trying too hard to ruin the gameplay

### 1. Mileage Mechanism

Basically, this game is often not so easy to get money because of some messy mechanics or inexplicable mechanics. But you must get a mileage voucher when you go out of the island. Mileage rolls can only be farmed.

This ensures that the player will obediently do the quest farm mileage.

Can't cheat cheat modification. And the mileage itself is sometimes tied to some limited products that cannot be bought with money, and can only be exchanged with mileage coupons.

### 2. Game time from 5:00-22:00 in the morning

If the player is too hardworking, they will "finish" the game ahead of time and stop the game

So basically the game has designed several mechanisms:

- New story progress will not be available until 5:00 in the morning
- The store will only open at 9:00 in the morning and will remain open until 22:00. The rest of the time is 20% off, and the money is given one day later to reduce the turnover rate of players. Many players care about this 20% (because of avoiding losses). There will be some moderation in farming
- The application for building a house and a bridge will be completed the next day

During that time, I obediently went to bed at 22:30 at night. Get up at 6:00 am and play games. Simply unhealthy.

## Incentive mechanism (arouse players' desire for endless exploration and generate variable rewards)

### 1. Points program

This is a great mechanism. Every time the player completes some small tasks. will get points. Or open an unknown achievement card. It's all centralized. It probably takes 3-5 repetitions to get it.

This will cause players to keep farming. One by one. (Achievement)

### 2. Collectibles

The museum is really a great mechanism. Players will try to fill their own museum collections. Every day insist on catching insects, catching fish and digging fossils. Just to fill the showroom.

In the later stage, players will also find that there will be a Set. Japanese furniture, bamboo forest, meteor set...etc

In order to get the whole set of furniture together, I have to keep farming (rare power)

### 3. Special Holidays or Events

When you think that the game is already farming is not fun. Here comes another holiday.

like Easter or a fishing contest

It makes players spend all day fishing to collect fishing jackpots. Or save eggs for a whole week until you vomit, and change to a complete Easter collection. (Ownership Power) (Rare Power)

### 4. Unique Island

When you become a farmer god, KK also comes. At this point, the terrain tool is unlocked. Can cover rivers and waterfalls. Even paving.

You can finally shovel away all the deformed land and re-plan it to what you want. (Ownership Momentum) (Creation Momentum)

At this time, if the entire island is prepared and the city is redrawn, and the money for the city's redefinition is still available, it will take another whole week...

Not to mention that when the house gets bigger, it has to be filled with furniture. It is simply a trouble with ivory chopsticks.

Especially when you leave the island and see your friend's island and then look at your own island, it's just like slag...... (Social Motivation) (Creative Motivation)

## A month in the spirit time house

This is why normal people can passively surround themselves with attention for a whole month.

This breaks my previous record for playing games. You know, I play a 3A masterpiece (Red Dead Redemption 2) or GTA5, and it takes less than two weeks to complete the game.

It's a miracle that Animal Crossing finally allowed me to play for a whole month. In fact, it's not just "Animal Crossing" that has such magic. "Dragon Quest Creation Players 2" is a similar set of arguments.

These two games seem to be very light games, but they use ingenious mechanisms to allow players to farm an island continuously for a whole month with very low effort every day.

To put it bluntly, it's really incredible.

In fact, the same game mechanism, we can also transplant it to courses and self-study.

don't you believe it? Let me show you how in the next chapter!
