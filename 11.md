# Reading (1) - Build superhuman reading ability

By the tenth chapter, the book should theoretically be over.

The main point of this book is to rediscover a set of learning processes that are innate in oneself.

teach science

- Chop up your troubles
- Reset small goals and big goals
- Deliberate practice, addiction
- Push yourself into a positive loop.

If you can re-deconstruct your own learning process according to the method of creating superhuman learning, and run it again, there will be rapid quantitative and qualitative changes.

In fact, it is enough for the average person to read this.

However, after reading the first draft of this book, my friend put forward some advanced requirements to me. You are reinventing a learning method, he said. But there are some topics you haven't covered in this book?

- How to apply this set of theories and processes to actual learning scenarios: "reading", "taking notes", and "classing".
- Could you please show us how you taught yourself.
- Can this method also be applied to programming and language learning?

Do it for good people. So I simply put the original content that can be written and created Superman Learning 2 as an "application chapter" and simply added it directly into this book.

The so-called over-coding link is to see or not to see. If you don't read it, it will not affect your understanding of the process. Looking at it can improve the efficiency of your execution at each step, as well as the speed of dismantling in various fields.

In later chapters of this book, we will discuss the following topics:

- How to read
- How to take notes
- How to take classes
- How to teach yourself
- How to teach yourself programming
- How to teach yourself a language

### Efficient reading is the beginning of learning

On the road of self-study, the most common theme that makes everyone kick the stone is nothing more than the link of "reading". The reason is very simple, because the fastest and cheapest way for everyone to learn is to read "books" by themselves.

Books are even the best channel for knowledge transfer that can travel through time, space and geographical constraints.

However, although this medium reduces the difficulty of "getting" knowledge, it is not very difficult to "eat in".

Even "reading" for many people is the biggest threshold on the road to learning. Because most people need at least a few hours to finish reading a book, and they don’t necessarily remember the contents, let alone make notes.

At the beginning, the starting point of the "Building a Superman" series was "Building a Superhuman Brain", and even a set of "extremely fast reading methods" in it, emphasizing "reading a book efficiently and taking notes in 30 minutes" before it became popular. .

The core method proposed by the speed reading method is:

1. List the questions and answers you want to get in this book in advance, as a goal
2. When reading, only focus on finding the solution, and other irrelevant ones can be skipped directly
3. Focus on picking up 16 effective solutions only in notes
4. After reading it, organize it into three key points immediately, and repeat the key points to your friends to strengthen your long-term memory

This seems to be a simple method, but it uses many of the principles of human brain operation, so it is very effective.

However, after the launch of this new reading method, I have received some related questions from readers one after another. It is found that the problem of reading is not as simple as the need to efficiently read and write notes.

Even later, I did a big survey on the reading group, only to find that there are so many questions about "reading" that it is astounding. "Speed" is even a small part of it.

- If you buy it and forget to read it, you can’t find the book and buy it repeatedly. When you read it, you can feel it. The category you want to read is not at hand, otherwise you have to fix the place to read
- Not sure how to improve the chances of finding a good book, reading notes are usually handwritten but want to be electronic
  - 1. Fear of buying bad books
  2. I don't know how to find books
  3. Even if I took a book that my good friend wrote the recommendation sequence and took a look, I had a chance to come across a very good book. I felt lost about the part of finding books.
- Sometimes from the title of the book or the online content introduction, I buy books that are far from expectations. I recently bought a book related to "service design" and felt like stepping on the thunder.
- The logical structure of the book is different from your own thinking, and it is difficult to read.
- Online book reviews are not allowed to be afraid of wasting money/No e-books are afraid that the more you buy, the more space you will take up/No time to look at them will take up space/A few years after you buy them, they will become outdated/Books are written from the basics
- Buying books and looking for books to read feel that the learning speed is too slow, it is much faster to go directly to the class of the Great God
- My reading time is when I commute to and from get off work. I don't have a pen and paper at hand, so I rarely take reading notes.
- When I look for books, I always read which book my FB friends say is good, buy it for a round, or buy some bestsellers recently, and the things I learn only stay at the stage of ~ oh I know~
- I usually read a book in fragments, so sometimes a book may be read in ten times, but some concepts in the book are coherent. If you read it in too many times, you will forget what you read before when you read it later. As a result, you often have to go forward to review what you have read a few times before, but this will lead to low reading efficiency. I don't know if there is any other way to solve this problem other than setting aside a bit longer to read.
- When reading and learning new knowledge and courses, lack of strength can't judge the correct content or the strength of the writer, and it is impossible to have background knowledge or other background knowledge, so it is very circling, high energy consumption and low efficiency, in short, often sleepy In the end of "using the unknown to explain the unknown".
- Buying books to study is to hope for actual progress. The problem is that no one draws a map (learning path map). To see actual growth and achievement requires one step at a time and quizzes, but many books are "knowledge preaching" (I think this description is very appropriate) Obtaining spiritual satisfaction, in fact, after reading and reciting, there is still no way to clearly output. I feel quite embarrassed.
- How to allocate energy and manage, I don't know if I have learned enough, or if I have learned too much. There are many things I have learned endlessly, I don't know where to stop, but I will be too tired if I want to learn more.
- I am very happy to learn for the sake of interest, but it seems a little wasteful to spend time learning these things without making money.
- Learning skills for survival, feels fulfilling but sometimes not as fun
- After writing the notes, they are finished, and they are not very accumulated.
- When reading, although you will look for answers to questions that you are interested in or may be from the catalog, but it is easy to miss the key points after reading, or there are too many key points, and when you are greedy and want to learn everything, you often go to the back Didn't learn anything.
- Too many books to read, I don't know where to start.
- Reading notes in various formats, notebooks, blank paper, word, scattered everywhere.
- The problem that you want to solve at present is too huge to be effectively disassembled, find the real problem and then find the answer for the real problem.
- When I buy a book, I often see that the copywriting is well written and I buy it. In terms of finding books, using Amazon to find books will recommend books with high similarity, which will make you tired. In addition, I want to look for books in different fields, but I don't know how to evaluate the quality of books.
- The title of the book is different from what I want. I feel like the author is going around and around, so I can't read it anymore.
- It's written in Chinese, but I can't read it, and I can't read it anymore
- I don't remember much after reading the book, I feel that I have dementia
- Don't know where to start? Should you buy a primer? Will it be too shallow? Read it and be laughed at?
- What is a good book? What is the definition of good? Is it easy to read, understand, and absorb?
- Are you used to buying books only on the interface or platform you are familiar with? ex: The source of the blog to the book is limited
- Fragmented learning will always be interrupted due to work
  Where are the scattered notes recorded in different apps when I can't find/forgot to find information?
- No time or too lazy to tidy up
- No induction or integration into one's own

I collected these questions and marked them with TAG to summarize

![](images/20211024111750.png)

It is found that your problem can be reduced to the following three topics:

- How to find
- How to sieve
- How to absorb

## 1. Increase the chance of finding a good book

To build superhuman reading ability, a key point is to improve the quality of reading content. But here comes the problem. Buying a good book is a rare thing.

The tangled point of many friends is that they often buy bad books on the market, but they take time to read them and take notes to know whether the book is good or not.

Is there a way to increase the chances of getting a good book? Can you buy a good book in the first round?

### Three rounds of buying calligraphy

My answer to this is a bit odd, my real experience coming home after buying thousands of books is, "You can't buy enough good books in the first round."

Why is this conclusion?

This starts with the knowledge (reader) and the gold content of the book itself. Both are related.

Generally speaking, in the first round, due to various factors, the last books we will buy are usually these kinds of books.

![](images/20211024135846.png)

- Title Party (being tricked in by the cover title, book cover, and recommendation sequence)
- Shuishu (the whole book talks about it in general terms, and the useful content is only two sentences)
- Difficult book (people say this book is great, but I can't read it myself)
- Wrong book (open and talk about it, the direction is completely wrong)
- Books that you can just read (books that you can read and find useful)

It's normal if you have the chance to keep buying the wrong book. As far as my own experience is concerned, I can even share it with you very accurately. In the first round, even if I buy a book that is just understandable and usable. Probably only a 20% chance.

There are various reasons for this. Some readers are not good enough, and some books are really watery. There are also readers who thought they could be proficient in one book. There are also some who can understand and can't use it, and need to set up multiple books to read.

In short, the books bought in the first round have a winning rate of only 20%, which means that buying 20 books that are most useful is 4-6 books.

Most people usually stop here when they come here. I think my ability to pick books is too poor or the field is too difficult.

In fact, it is not, but you do not know the calculation method of book hit rate and the best practice of picking and reading books.

When I was buying books, the odds weren't really high. But my friends often think that I can always buy divine books. That's because, I actually bought enough books. And there is a set of book selection methods.

Also, for me, the first round of books is not meant to be "read". Instead, it is used for "field filtering".

Through a large number of simultaneous pages, find

- The real key to this field
- Among the possible vague principles
- The method process everyone is talking about

Then use this information to find the second round of books. Yes, you read that right, the book is going to buy the second round. Not only to buy the second round, but also to buy the third round.

Don't be discouraged by buying so many "useless books" in the first round. In fact, from another angle, these books are also very useful.

- Title Party (being tricked into by the cover title, book cover, and recommendation sequence) → only the cover title and book cover are left, and the book body is lost.
- Shuishu (The whole book is talking about generalities, and the useful content is only two sentences) → Use notes to copy the only useful two or three sentences in it.
- Difficult book (some people say this book is great, but I can't read it myself) → save it for now and read it later
- Wrong book (open it and talk about it, the direction is completely wrong) → throw it away

In fact, these books are not wrong to buy. It's just a misplacement of useful information. If you will be tricked in by the title and cover, it means that the title and cover must be going in the right direction that you think subconsciously. you will buy. So what you should keep is not the body, but the cover.

Again, a useful book doesn't mean that the entire book has to be super dry. But if there are a few sentences in it that work for you, then this book can also be called a useful book. Even, I once bought a book in which only one sentence of the preface was useful to me, and the whole book was completely useless. But, I really only need that sentence!

### Second round of buying books

Then, according to the conclusion of the first round of screening books, you go to buy the second round of books. Accuracy will be much improved.

Because at this time, you usually have been promoted from "people who didn't know anything" to "people who probably know what important information in the field" is.

At this time, you can go to Amazon's related recommendations. In no time will you discover a lot of books that you missed. At this time, my principle is that on the introduction page of the book, if there is an edge (judged by the information sorted out in the first round), it will be closed.

Don't worry, this time the accuracy rate won't be as terrible as the 20% drop in the first round. The odds of buying books in this round really increase to 60-70%. Usually I buy 7 out of 10 in this round.

Here are some tips for buying books. Usually, I will also buy books related to the author that I found the "right book" in the first round, and the accuracy will be very high. This is because of the same author, the cosmology is usually close and even evolving. Therefore, if you buy a book from the same author, the hit rate will be very high.

Then, you can also refer to the book review website "Douban" or a similar book review website. Look through the messages below, and sometimes you can follow the clues to see what books others have read. Or what books are recommended in the comments.

### How to improve the hit rate of the first round of buying books

After reading this, some readers may want to ask more tips on how to improve the hit rate of the first round of books.

Actually there is a way. There are several reasons why first-round book hits are low, but most of them are readers:

- If you want to buy a book, you can solve the problem, so you buy a book that is too difficult for yourself
- Sometimes books that are important in the field are actually written in a very approachable manner in order for beginners to understand, but because they seem too simple. On the contrary, it was directly skipped by beginners, thinking that it was too simple to buy.
- Beginners mostly want to know the theory and feel that the practice is not important, so they skip all the "how to do" books.

Generally speaking. My exclusive secret to buying a first-round book is:

![](images/20211024112104.png)

I only target these keywords

- Illustration
- children
- newbie
- ten times
- superman
- Zero-based
- Encyclopedia

In these books, a lot of useful processes are usually sorted out and explained in simple terms. These books are usually ignored by the general reader.

I usually find the book in the third round, and when I go back and read it again, I often find that the truth lies in these seemingly "too simple" books.

### The third round of buying books

In the second round of buying books. I can usually already follow the books bought in the second round and put the

- Field key core
- Five cores
- 1-3 feasible major practices (examples, steps)

Clear combing notes came out.

At this time, I will go to the books found in the second round to see if the authors have mentioned other authors' books, and then buy them again.

Why is this? The principle is that, in fact, each book is the comprehensive "excretion" of many books that the author has read by himself. Generally speaking, books are rarely original, and most of them are books that the author has read a lot of books and has done a lot of research on. Integrate and integrate, and then re-integrate your own theories into your own views and perspectives. So there are very few sources of attribution.

But if the source of the source is clearly marked in the book, it means that the book was inspired by the original author. If you look up, you will usually find that the source of information is more pure.

This is the real "recommendation".

And usually in this round, the hit rate is usually as high as 80%. Bought 4 out of 5.

### Chances of getting a good book are 50%

![](images/20211024112136.png)

If we add up the numbers of book purchases in these three rounds, you will find that the probability that we actually buy the "correct" book is almost 50%.

No wonder you feel like you're always buying bad books. Because the probability of not being able to buy is really high. But it's just that many people don't know that to buy books, you need to buy more than three floors. When you buy calligraphy through these three layers, you can accurately collect most of the key knowledge in this field.

Also, I find that many people have some weird myths when buying books.

For example, new book = good book. This is not necessarily necessary. Because according to every book is the excrement of the author. In fact, sometimes, new books are more concentrated than thinner books. When I was reading some books in the older fields, I found that divine books were often published decades ago and out of print.

Compared with modern times, there is no better bibliography written.

Or, some people will be confused. Obviously everyone on the market recommends the same book. I went to buy the book myself, but found that it was written very well, and the important theories were full of errors. I even began to wonder if it was my own fault or the book's fault.

This is because according to the Dreyfus model, the most books on the market are advanced novices, and the same is true for books written by senior novices. The most recommended book does not mean that it is the "correct" book, or even the "correct theory and practice". It's a book that "reads it feels very powerful, but doesn't know it".

Even when I read books to the end, I found that most of those super good books have two phenomena: "unpopular and out of print" and "it seems too simple to be ignored".

Of course we all want to find the Book of God in the first place. But I would say that this is actually a process. Books are not meant to be found the first time you want.

But the key is how we should establish a method of sifting books to find books. And we must carefully screen to the third round.

Actually no need to feel troublesome. After reading the next chapter, you will realize the importance of multiple rounds of book selection.
