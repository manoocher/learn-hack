# Fifth chapter master is using the deliberate practice four-step method

There is a best-selling book, called "deliberate practice". The main theory of this book is that the so-called masters are not relying on the talents, but these masters have the habit of deliberate practice. Let them go to the peak.

And the author even mentioned that "quantity" in light is not enough, but also the "quality" of the training, it will be able to master the "effective training method", will be the last winner.

This is really very reasonable. But it is also very interesting. because

- What is "Quality"?
- What is "effective training"?
- What is "quantity"?

In this book "deliberate practice", in] "Chapter VII - Towards the Extraordinary Road Map", it refers to the key three steps:

- develop interest
-
- fully focus

These three steps are also very reasonable. But you still feel that this is nonsense.

Because our ordinary people are only ordinary interest, I don't know how to force myself to become serious, and how much time is it?

Therefore, many people will feel that "deliberate practice" is very reasonable to "deliberately practice" this book. But I don't know how to do "how to do it", I finally calculated!

### The true step of deliberate practice, as well as ongoing key

This is because, such as deliberately practicing such a subject, the description is "result".

These authors are almost not "master", and horses are just a "behavior" research team. They just have such a "feature" in seeing the master's growth process, so thinking that these elements are the key.

But in the end, they never know:

- How to do "Quality deliberate practice"?
- How to have the devil's self-exercise until the master of the master.
- Through the principle of brain science behind the master path

So, when you are watching these learning books, there is a feeling of itching.

### step 1: First study procedures

We have an important emphasis on the importance of "programmatic" knowledge in front of the chapter. This is because, the procedural knowledge (process) is very good.

- Process skeleton is useful to remember to learn "muscles" that is very difficult to forget. If you use "brain" to learn, it is very easy to be brushing.
- Based on a process skeleton, there is a blurred but have a deterministic process. Humans like the results of "deterministic".
- Based on this "deterministic" process, related fine crushing knowledge can be easily adhered to the top to form a memory network.
- So the priority knowledge of the first generation, the "factual" "conceptual" knowledge. It can be said to be a match. With a strong carrier (muscle gangma), the memory (brain) can be used to store memory.

However, if you use the opposite order, you will be very slow .....

### step 2: Quick practice after learning

Because humans have time effect. If it is just a short-lived painting, these nerves are not protected.

Even, if it is just a practice, then dragging the second-pass exercise for a long time (for example, after two weeks, after a month), it will even begin leakage steps.

And if it is a fact or conceptual knowledge. These knowledge is stored within the brain, so that their expiration time will be shorter. Maybe it will be frotted within two or three days of completion or after reading the book.

Therefore, its true key is to finish the completion, soon will practice several times, and engage in the most critical conceptual knowledge.

### step 3: Duplicate exercises, and adjust the parameters in

Humans have a mirror-phase neuron learning function, so it represents a rough process that can be probably copied by the demonstration of others.

But this doesn't mean:

- We can copy perfect results in our first time.
- When we do a few times of exercises, we can use the whole set of processes to make a high level.

We are likely to get, but some have achieved the purpose, but the result is some of the eight.

There is a common phenomenon, it is "new hand." Usually this is to describe some white paper novices, the first time I tried to learn a certain skill, and the result is very amazing. This phenomenon will be because

- What does the teacher do what the teacher does what the teacher said. The teacher taught all his own perfect results that he had trained countless times, so the first effect is of course very good.
- This teacher is very powerful, know where the newcomer will fell, so fill the pit. So the novice walked through a pit road, naturally thought that he was a field genius. And the seniors are idiots, and spend so much time to practice this level. (This is why some newers will think that many things, I have learned it over and over again, and I feel that I don't need "practice". This situation is mostly because it is the reason for the teacher rather than the student.)

In fact, we have to say "Society", and finally reach a realm, called "Stable Output". That is, it is possible to make it anytime, anywhere, and at least 80 points.

This is actually not shortcut, and it is anti-weight. But this does not mean that it is repeated to make a boring action, but you have to pursue this time you have twice as fast as the speed, or more than two times the benefits, results.

Listening to you will think that this standard seems to be a bit high, but this "high" standard will launch a strong motive in the process of learning, in order to pursue this results, you will have motivated to try, try the process. Which change can achieve such an effect.

You may think that it is nothing to go home, it is a little lazy. But here I may tell you a data, according to my informal statistics with some teacher friends: 100 people probably learn a skill, will go back to practice only 10 people. There will be only one second. So you practice twice or more, you can probably 4 times faster and win about 99 people.

Moreover, with the perspective of the outer parallel white paper, if you can get four times faster than the person, you will be a "master".

It sounds more powerful now!

### step 4: Target with ten times a hundred times, to disassemble the process and restructuring

But if you want to be a real master, practice it is not enough. You may have to practice at least 5-10 times, or even 20 times, even 100 times.

Hearing here, readers may be even more lazy.

We are so busy in society, where to practice so many times. If this is the interest as a profession, is it possible? Otherwise, how can normal people have been doing so many times.

I have a stealing course learning method:

> After practicing two or three times, it is 2 times the time to practice. You have to put the target twice a time.

Of course, you will feel that this is possible. 2 times is a bit difficult, how fast is 10 times. But I have to tell you, it is entirely possible.

I can raise my past, two examples used.

(1) From 30 days to 14 days, to 1 day, then to 3 hours.

I have worked in the network in the past. At that time, the company had a task, it is to keep the entire service landing page (is the first page, you can let customers know the benefits of our goods, the vision, the principle behind the operation behind). At that time, the entire team did no one, to copy other companies' pages, and changed the seven 歪 八, finally, spending the entire team almost 30 days, only to make this whole page, and the performance has also grown substantially.

However, I think if I have to be a "activity" next time, I have to go to Landing Page, if I have been 30 days, I can't stand it. So I think there is any way to accelerate.

With the previous results, and some other companies' templates. I found that this Landing page can be dismantled. Landing Page can be divided into six blocks from top to bottom. And most of the effective advertisements are similar structures.

! [] (iMages / 20211026111531.png)

- describe his own benefits
- Three benefits to using this service
- Narrative operation principle, or schematic diagram, short film
- Users witness or media reports
- Call to Action
- FAQ / Free Registration / Refund Guarantee (eliminating doubts)

(IE Since I published "Growth Hack this" "Lightning Development" 2nd book, the product page between Taiwan is almost beginning to become this form that will make people's second hand, do not believe you can be on Facebook Take a look at the pages of the type of advertising, do you take such a structure.)

After discovering this six block modules. I found some modules and copied directly. Some is to rewrite into their own services with similar structures, and the goods are described. It will be able to move.

So our time for the second time, it took only 14 days. Later, I felt that it took 14 days or for too long, I would like to study the practice of doing within 1 day. However, the key card is in inspiration and service, I will dismiss the principles and basic elements of this six blocks, and find that they must be able to generate inspiration, as long as the questionnaire first, ask consumers three questions:

- When you use, do it, learn OOO, and after you have done. What goals do you most want to reach?
- When you learn, buy, know what you want to do most after OOO?
- What is your most annoying thing when you are doing OOO?

That is, why, what, how. After you collect approximately 50-100 customers, there is basically a lot of inspiration to fill in the template.

Later, we even compressed this process into 3 hours, you can write the entire landing page skeleton.

(Detailed steps can be seen "Lightning Development")

(2) Half year, one month, 7 days, 1 day.

At present, I have already had a lot of books. Frankly, when writing the first book, it is my most painful experience. Because there are many things you want, you can't organize yourself. Later, the first book "Growth Hack did this", or use the sequence of sports in my teaching, expanded into a book, editor also helped me make a big modification, and finally I was published.

But when you have a second book, I feel that this half a year can write a book is too folded. It is impossible to come back again. So I started researching how to write books faster. Later, I found the biggest problem because I wrote a book, I didn't define the target crowd, and there was no backbone in the middle. I didn't know where to write.

So, I will study how to solve such problems. I found that if you want to leave, then you will not walk. As a result, the method of writing this, letting the second book of the second book, compressed to a month.

Then when I wrote a third book, I found that after I have solved the problem of writing the book, then I found the book's most exhausted thing is to write while I want to write. How to speed up this process? I found that I can talk about it first, and then tell the letter to the letter. As a result, I found that the book time can be compressed to 7 days.

I am very exciting to find this result. So I want to challenge an impossible task, can I write a book 2 days. I went to dismantle my past writing process, then write into the Raiders "Extreme Sketch Calligraphy", followed by this Raiders, and finally I have written a book "Distinguished work".

And it is so fast, does not mean the difference in writing. The few books in my back are all written, but they are very nice, but also sell not bad.

### The master is over, it is looking for flow, practice, dismantling, reinventing

The above two examples are not for writing to show off. Instead, I want to let readers know that sometimes I am studying the standard, but it will prompt you to disassemble the entire process and study the solution. In turn, the unreasonability of the original process is found, even 10 times.

And the exercise time and number of exercises, there will be a lot more than you think (like I practice a book, I only spend four or five exercises). The final result is quite amazing (for example, a book is written in one day, it is the original hundred times faster).

Not only is "Quality of Practice", but also the efficient training method. And in the end, you will have interest, become serious, and put wholehearted!
