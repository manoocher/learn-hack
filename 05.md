# Chapter 5 The four-step method of deliberate practice that the masters are using

There is a best-selling book in the market called "Deliberate Practice". The main theory of this book is that the so-called masters are not based on talent, but these masters have the habit of deliberate practice. so that they can reach the top.

The author even mentioned that the "quantity" of training alone is not enough, and the "quality" of training must also be possessed, and the one who can master the "efficient training method" will be the final winner.

This is very reasonable. But also very boring. because

- What is "quality"?
- What is "efficient training"?
- What is the "quantity"?

In the book "Deliberate Practice", in] "Chapter 7 - Roadmap to Extraordinary", three key steps are mentioned:

- develop interest
- become serious
- fully focus

These three steps also make perfect sense. But you still feel it's nonsense.

Because most of us have only ordinary interests, let alone how to force ourselves to become serious, and how much time does it take to devote ourselves to it?

Therefore, after reading this book, many people will feel that the "concept" proposed by "deliberate practice" is very reasonable. But after reading it, I don't know "how to do it", and finally just forget it!

### The real steps of deliberate practice, and the key to persistence

This is because books on topics such as deliberate practice are all about "results."

Almost all of these authors are not "experts", and they are just "behavioral" research teams. They just saw that the growth process of the masters has such "characteristics", so they think that these elements are the key.

But in the end, they still don't know:

- How to do "quality deliberate practice"?
- How to be possessed by self-training until the master state.
- Relevant brain science principles behind the path to master

Therefore, when you read these study books, you will feel that you are scratching your head.

### Step 1: Learn procedural knowledge first

In the previous chapters, we have repeatedly emphasized the importance of learning "procedural" knowledge first. This is because it is very beneficial to learn procedural knowledge (process) first.

- The process skeleton is learned by using "muscles" that can be remembered very firmly and not easily forgotten. If you use "brain" to learn, it is very easy to be washed away.
- And based on a process skeleton, there is a vague but deterministic process. Humans like "certain" results.
- Based on this "deterministic" process, relevant details can be easily attached to it to form a memory network with correlation.
- So learn procedural knowledge first, and then learn "factual" and "conceptual" knowledge. It can be said to be a perfect match. Using a carrier (muscle nerve bundle) that can be remembered very firmly, the memory (brain) can store memories in a mesh-like bond.

However, if you do it in reverse order it will be slow to learn...

### Step 2: Quickly practice several times after learning

Because human memory is time-sensitive. These nerve bundles are not protected if it is only briefly drawn.

Even, if you only practice once, and then delay the second practice for a long time (for example, after two weeks or a month), you will even start to miss steps.

And if it's factual or conceptual knowledge, it's even worse. This knowledge is stored in the brain, so it means that their expiration time will be shorter. It may be washed away within two or three days of finishing a class or reading a book.

So the real key is to practice the process several times and understand the most critical conceptual knowledge soon after learning.

### Step 3: Repeat the exercise and adjust the parameters

Humans all have mirror neuron learning capabilities, so this means that we can roughly replicate the rough process after seeing others demonstrate it once.

But this doesn't mean:

- We can reproduce perfect results the first time when we do it ourselves
- When we do the follow-up exercises, we can control the whole process at will and make high-level results

We are likely to get, but some achieve the purpose, but the result is a bit crooked.

A common phenomenon is "new luck". Usually this is a description of some newbies who are trying to learn a certain skill for the first time, and the results are very amazing. This phenomenon occurs because

- Beginners are terrified, so do what the teacher says. And what the teacher teaches is the perfect result that he has practiced countless times and adjusted, so the first time the effect is of course very good.
- This teacher is very good. He knows in advance where the novice will fall, so he fills all the holes first. Therefore, the novice has walked a path without pits, and naturally thinks that he is a genius in the field. And the seniors are idiots, it takes so much time to practice to this point. (This is also why some newbies think that they will "get it" after they have learned a lot of things, and then feel that they don't need to "practice". Most of this is because the teacher is better than the student.)

In fact, we have to say "learning", and finally reach a state called "stable output". That is, it can be used anytime and anywhere, and it must have at least an 80-point effect.

In fact, there is no shortcut, it relies on repeated repetition. But this does not mean that you are repeating a boring action, but that you must pursue this time twice as fast as the last time, or more than twice the benefits and results.

After listening to it, you will feel that this standard seems to be a bit high, but this "high" standard will activate a strong motivation for you in the learning process. In order to pursue this achievement, you will have the motivation to understand and try. Which variable can achieve this effect.

You may feel a little lazy to practice several times when you go home. But here I may tell you a statistic, based on informal statistics I have with some teacher friends: 100 people have probably learned a skill, and only about 10 people will go back to practice it again. There is probably only one person who will practice the second time. So if you practice more than twice, you will probably be 4x faster and win about 99 people.

And, from a layman's point of view, if you can beat 99 classmates four times faster, you're already a "master".

Sounds more motivating now!

### Step 4: Aiming at ten times the speed, disassemble and reorganize the process

But if you want to become a real master, one practice is not enough. You may have to practice at least 5-10 times, even 20 times, or even 100 times.

Hearing this, readers, maybe even more lazy.

We are so busy in the society, how can we have the time to practice so many times in the United States. This is more likely if you regard your hobby as a career, right? Otherwise, how could a normal person keep doing it so many times.

Here I provide a sneak learning method:

> After two or three repetitions of the exercise aiming at 2x speed. You're going to aim to be ten times faster at a time.

Of course, you wonder how this is possible. 2 times is a bit difficult, how can it be 10 times faster. But I'm telling you, it's entirely possible.

I can give two examples that I have used in my past books.

(1) From 30 days to 14 days, to 1 day, to 3 hours.

I used to work for an internet company. At that time, the company had a task to redo the Landing Page of the entire service (the home page, which lets customers know at a glance the benefits, vision, and working principles behind our products). At that time, no one in the entire team had done it. They copied the pages of other companies and changed them in various ways. In the end, it took the entire team almost 30 days to make this entire page, and the performance naturally increased significantly.

However, I think that if I want to do an "event" next time, I want to engage in a Landing Page, if I also come for 30 days, I can't stand it. So I was wondering if there is any way to speed it up.

With the results of the last time, as well as some other companies' templates. I found that this Landing Page can be disassembled. The Landing Page can be divided into six blocks from top to bottom. And most effective ads are similarly structured.

![](images/20211026111531.png)

- Describe your benefits in one sentence
- Three benefits of using this service
- Describe how it works, or create schematics, short videos
- User testimonials or media reports
- CALL TO ACTION
- FAQ / Free Registration / Money Back Guarantee (to remove doubts)

(ie, since I published the two books "Growth Hack Do This" and "Lightning Development", almost all product pages and company pages in Taiwan have begun to turn into a form that will make people buy hands in seconds. If you don't believe me, you can do it on Facebook. Look at those one-page ad pages for that structure.)

After discovering these six modules. I found that some modules are directly copied. Some just use a similar structure to rewrite their own service and commodity descriptions. can move.

So the second time we did Landing Page, it only took 14 days. Later, I felt that 14 days was too long, and I wanted to study how to do it in 1 day. But the key card is inspiration and service narrative. I will disassemble the principles and basic elements behind the composition of these six blocks. I found that in order to generate inspiration in batches, we only need to send out questionnaires and ask consumers three questions:

- After you've used it, done it, learned to OOO, and done something. What do you most want to achieve?
- When you learn, buy, and know OOO, what do you most want to do?
- What do you hate the most when you're doing OOO?

That is, Why, What, How. After you have collected about 50-100 customer feedback, there is basically a lot of inspiration to fill in the template.

Later, we even compressed this process to a person who can write the entire Landing Page skeleton within 3 hours.

(For detailed steps, see "Lightning Development")

(2) Half a year, one month, 7 days, 1 day.

I have published many books so far. Frankly speaking, writing the first book was my most painful experience. Because there are so many things I want to write, I can't organize them myself. Later, the first book, "Growth Hack Do This," was expanded into a book using the sequence of slides I taught, and the editor also helped me with a lot of retouching before it was finally published.

But when the second book was published, I felt that it was too torturous to be able to write a book in half a year. It's impossible to do it all over again. So I started researching how to write books faster. Later, I discovered that the biggest problem was that when I wrote the book, I didn't define the target group well, and there was no backbone in the middle, and I didn't know where to go when I wrote it at the end.

So, I went to study how to solve this problem. I found that if you don't want to go crooked, then simply write upside down and it won't go crooked. As a result, this method of writing backwards has shortened the writing time of my second book to one month.

Then when I wrote the third book, I found that after solving the problem of writing a book in a twist, I found that the most labor-intensive thing about writing a book is writing while thinking. How to speed up this process? I found that I could actually use the narration first, and then revise the verbatim version of the narration. As a result, I found that the writing time can be shortened to less than 7 days.

I was so excited to find this result. So I want to challenge an impossible task, whether it is possible to write a book in 2 days. I went to dismantle my writing process in the past, and then wrote a guideline called "Extremely Fast Writing Calligraphy", and then finished writing according to this guideline. Finally, I completed a book "Working from a Distance Do This" in an incredible amount of time.

And writing so fast doesn't mean writing badly. The next few books I wrote were written quickly, but they were all very good looking and sold well.

### The advantage of a master is to find the process, practice, dismantle, and reinvent

The above two examples are not written to show off. But I want to let readers know that sometimes when you are studying, setting a higher standard will prompt you to disassemble the whole process and study the solution. And then find the irrationality of the original process, or even 10 times the best practice.

And the time and frequency of practice you need will be much less than you think (for example, I finished writing the book in one day, and only spent four or five practice sessions). And the final result is quite amazing (for example, writing a book in one day, which is a hundred times faster than the original).

Not only has the "quality of practice", but also an efficient training method. And in the end you get interested, serious, and committed!
