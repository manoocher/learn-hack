# Chapter 4 Scientifically practice memory, talk about "remembering" and "learning"

Regarding learning, what many people are most worried about is what to do if they "can't remember" after learning, especially after forgetting the basic knowledge, it becomes difficult to move an inch.

Therefore, the articles on mnemonics on the market have been very strong.

### The so-called learning, what are we pursuing?

If you can't remember what you've learned, you forget it all at once. How can we strengthen this skill?

Before going any further on this topic, I want to talk about another topic first.

What are we looking for when it comes to learning?

I think the answer for many people is: "remember" and "learn"

However, I think a lot of people confuse "remembering" with "learning" when it comes to learning the subject.

Common cognition is that once you "remember" with your brain, you "learn" it.

In fact, the order of these two actions is reversed.

The correct order is that humans should "learn" before they "remember", and those who "remember" may not "learn", right?

This sentence seems to make sense, but it feels a bit confusing.

Let me move on to a more in-depth description, which again must start with the principles of long-term memory construction.

### 1. The memory structure of the brain is a network

We often think that memory is built up bit by bit in the brain, and the brain is a big storage room that can accommodate our infinite stuff.

But in fact, what the brain can remember for a long time is an "interconnection" and "network", and the information you throw in will be glued to the existing related network. Or you have deliberately organized (notes, insights) into your own web of what you've learned.

That is, finally:

- Things that can be understood logically are easy to remember
- Relevant things are remembered
- Structured things are remembered

Therefore, if you don’t understand something right now, you can stick to a network without relevant information, and you don’t organize it afterwards, then the information will be washed away in an instant.

(This is why stories are easier to remember than theories. Because stories are an interesting and more complete and organized structure.)

### 2. Muscles can also remember things

Furthermore, we often think that only the brain can remember things, but in fact, the body can also remember things.

The so-called sensory memory of the body, the principle is that when the body performs an action, it will bring impulses to the nerve fibers. The so-called memory circuit of myelin is the transmission of electrical impulses through nerve fibers. Myelin is a layer of insulating material that wraps around the outside of the nerve pathway. When a part of the nerve pathway is used in practice, this part of the myelin sheath grows. The more you practice, the thicker the insulation and the faster the information in the pathway. This is the so-called "muscle memory" effect.

To be precise, it is not the muscles that are used for memory, but the nerve bundles. The more you practice, the wire on your body, the thicker the wire and the thicker the wire skin. So the faster the signal is transmitted, the less likely it is to be forgotten.

### 3. The human brain will desperately forget

Why do we forget some of the lessons we took and the books we read not long ago. There are two reasons:

(1) Information flushing

This is because, as you can imagine, the input to the human brain is an endless stream of information, and we have limited space to temporarily store this stream of information. You can compare this to the machine's Log (records every event that occurs on the day, but when the temporary storage area is full, the old information will be pushed out according to time, leaving only the most recent).

If we are not in the temporary storage area, we will "organize" the useful information in it and put it back into the storage space that can be stored for a relatively long time, such as the brain and nerve bundles.

These messages will be automatically washed away

(2) Memory loss of connection

Nerves are reticular connections. In theory, when you move the data to these longer storage spaces for storage, the storage time can be longer. However, if it is not accessed for too long, the connection to the memory of this piece may be broken.

You may have experienced some similar situations. There are some skills or knowledge that you are really familiar with in a few years, but they are useless for a long time, and you need to think back for a while before you can dig them back, but you can use them proficiently after you dig them back.

### The brain's memory is only refrigerated for one day

In related books on mnemonics, there is a concept "**Ebbinghaus forgetting curve"** often mentioned**. **

Psychologist Herman Ebbinghaus came up with his own experiments. In this experiment, Ebbinghaus used some meaningless letter combinations. This curve was obtained by memorizing these letter combinations and examining the rate of forgetting after a series of time intervals.

![](images/20211023161425.png)

- After 20 minutes, 42% are forgotten and 58% are remembered.
- After 1 hour, 56% were forgotten and 44% were remembered.
- After 1 day, 74% were forgotten and 26% were remembered.
- After 1 week, 77% were forgotten and 23% were remembered.
- After 1 month, 79% were forgotten and 21% were remembered.

So, usually scholars who study memory. We hope that after reading the book and class, we should review it immediately, otherwise it will be easy to forget.

But in fact, it only describes "the problem of time limit storage in the temporary storage area".

They also miss several things, if you're going to remember these things:

- ㄧ, first thing first, these information must be "you care", "care" means that it is related to your current goal.
- 2. These information must be stored in a network structure. that is
  - (1) You can understand the logic
  - (2) may be wrapped in a story
  - (3) This information should be linked with your past experience

Therefore, when we were studying in the past, teachers who were more able to teach and who were easier for you to learn usually used: stories, simple metaphors, and even jingle. Makes it easier for you to remember.

### We underestimate the importance of muscle memory

There is a tendency in schooling to lean heavily towards the importance of "brain remembering". As for the "experimental" and "practice" classes, these classes are easily sacrificed.

Because there is no "experiment" and "practice" classes, students will not be able to experience the wonderful memory brought by the use of "experiment" and "practice". I don't even know the power of "muscle memory" brought by "experiment" and "practice".

Therefore, most people are in such a long training. Seriously confuse "remember" with "learn". I think that the process of "remembering" can learn one thing. In fact, the standard to "learn" something is to repeat one thing without making mistakes.

But repetition uses muscles, not brains. And I boldly go further and say that by recording information in the muscles, it can break through the time limit of the brain's memory being washed away.

### Talking about brain memory and muscle memory

Why is muscle memory far stronger than brain memory?

Have you experienced something like this:

No matter what college you graduated from, you almost forgot all of your pre-college courses and gave them back to your teachers. However, most of the business skills learned after leaving the society are quite proficient. Remember very well.

Hobbies I liked when I was young, such as practicing taekwondo, playing football, playing pool, assembling computers when I was young, and playing shooting games. Although it will be slightly rusty as it grows up, the feel is usually still there.

Why is this?

### Declarative memory and non-declarative memory

There is a famous amnesiac HM in history.

In 1953, he underwent an experimental psychosurgery to remove parts of the hippocampus from his left and right brains in an attempt to slow the epilepsy that had plagued him. Unexpectedly, the surgery brought unimaginable consequences. The operation made him unable to generate new memories since then. I can't even remember who I talked to or what I ate every day.

But for this tragedy of HM, it is a very good gift for mankind. He agreed to have a neuroscientist, over the next few decades, as a research subject to explore the mysteries of memory.

And the most interesting research findings for HM. He will forget all kinds of things that happen every day. Although he lost his memory ability, he did not lose his skill ability.

Neuroscientists refer to this long-term memory loss from HM as **declarative memory**. The long-term memory of motor skills that HM remembers is called **non-declarative memory**.

I "think" this is an inaccurate description. Because long-term memory, especially the word "memory", we would think, is stored in the brain.

In fact, if you follow the theory of deliberately practicing thicker wires.

I think the operation of long-term memory should be as follows:

![](images/20211023161457.png)

Knowledge about "factual" and "conceptual" is stored in the brain and washed away after a while.

"Procedural" knowledge is stored in nerves and protected by myelin.

This explains why we gradually forget the knowledge of declarative memory over time. And the skills that have been practiced are almost hard to forget.

### Exercise System 1 instead of System 2

Of course, this is just my hypothesis. But later I will show why this theory is closer to reality.

In Daniel Conneman's book "Thinking Slowly", there is a famous theory of System 1 and System 2.

Point out that the operation mechanism of human brain is divided into system 1 and system 2.

- System 1 represents reflexive intuitive thinking
- System 2 represents rational thinking with step-by-step analysis.

The place where procedural knowledge is stored and invoked is System 1, and the place where concepts, facts, and meta-knowledge are invoked is in System 2.

In the book Fast Thinking and Slow Thinking, it is pointed out that human consciousness and actions are mostly completed automatically by system 1 intuition, and system 2 saves power and standby. Only when encountering difficulties and unfamiliar environments, system 2 will soberly change its decision-making. System 2 has the final say.

![](images/20211023161647.png)

The book Think Fast, Think Slow, mentions that System 2 has the final say. This statement seems plausible.

But as an engineer, I feel that such a statement is very inconsistent with the logic of "computer" design.

![](images/20211023161705.png)

This is because the speed of system 1 decision execution is about 15ms, but the speed of system 2 is more than 500ms.

If this speed is drawn as a system diagram, a human should look like this:

![](images/20211023161724.png)

Our bodies are automated by a series of fast, small subroutines.

There is a theory in academia that human beings should be rational people (especially finance and economics assume this), but in reality this may be completely untrue.

Because if human beings are rational people. In this entire system, decision-making should be dominated by the majority of System 2. However, in terms of communication execution speed, System 2 is completely incapable of System 1.

So when human emotions come up, the whole person will appear in such a state, and rationality will go offline.

When human beings are in a hurry, there is even a phenomenon: "talking is not enough for the brain".

![](images/20211023161750.png)

So a more reasonable situation should be:

Humans usually operate in a standby mode. Usually, when they encounter problems that have not been solved in the past, they will call the system 2 to search and determine possible solutions.

But the so-called rationality is just slowing down and searching for solutions that could be solved quickly in the past.

![](images/20211023161819.png)

Humans are essentially a series of unconscious rapid systems superimposed, so we usually perform tasks. In fact, it is composed of countless systems 1 superimposed and concatenated.

![](images/20211023161828.png)

When we are talking about human beings mostly use System 1 to execute automatically, System 2 is usually while sleeping. The picture is actually more like this:

![](images/20211023161839.png)

System 2 is not the person in the main driver's seat at all, but sees someone else driving in the passenger seat and mistakenly thinks it is driving by itself. When there is a problem, only step on the brake of 1.

When we talk about deliberate practice, it's often easy to think we're practicing System 2.

![](images/20211023161856.png)

In fact, we should be practicing System 1.

![](images/20211023161913.png)

### The object of deliberate practice should be procedural knowledge first and written into System 1

A few years ago, many people who were poisoned by traditional education would laugh when they heard the word muscular learning. I think it's a Boxer-style study method.

In fact, this cut-in angle is the most scientific, and it is easy to be deeply rooted and lasting. Because humans themselves are run continuously by countless small subroutines. Even the human body will continue to make the circuit of the subroutine grow stronger, and secrete substances to make the circuit protection layer thicker.

So on learning strategies. The most correct way should be to learn procedural knowledge as the main framework (bones), and after practicing procedural knowledge (and not easy to forget), then absorb factual knowledge (as muscles) to supplement.

Applying back the general skills to learn the scene of apprenticeship is:

1. First talk to the teacher about the common process of learning the basics
2. After the results are made on the spot. Go home and practice three times in a short period of time and remake the results three times
3. Then supplement the basic knowledge for the parts you don't understand.

Instead of memorizing a lot of nouns, and finally making up sentences by yourself, in the end, you can't say a complete sentence.

Because, as a beginner, you can't deduce the common basic process (sentence structure) and the necessary limited correct knowledge (where to use it, subtle tone and bounded copula) from factual knowledge (name). of.

Therefore, I will repeatedly emphasize the importance of "procedural" knowledge first.
