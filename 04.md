# 第四 科学 记 记, talk about "Remember" and "Society"

With regard to learning this, many people are most worried about learning, "can't remember" how to do, especially after the basic knowledge, don't do it.

Therefore, the article on memory on the market has been very comfortable.

### The so-called learning, what are we pursuing?

After learning, I can't remember it, I will forget it. How do we strengthen this skill?

Before I continue to talk about this topic, I want to talk to another topic first.

What is we seek about learning?

I think a lot of people is: "Remember" and "Society"

However, I think many people are confused with the "Remember" and "Society" in learning this topic.

Common cognition is to use the brain "Remember", "learning".

In fact, these two motion sequences are opposite.

The correct order is that human beings should be "learning" will "remember", and "remember" is not "learning", yes.

This sentence seems to be a bit reasonable, but it feels a bit around.

Let me continue to describe more in-depth stories, which in turn began to start from the principle of long-term memory construct.

### 1. The memory structure of the brain is a network construction

We often think that memory is a little bit of the composition, and the brain is a large store that accommodates our infinite plug.

But in fact, the brain can have a long time to remember the "interconnect" "net", the information you lost, it will be sticky to both related webs. Or you are deliberately sorted out (notes, comprehension), and make what you have learned into your own net.

That is, final:

- If there is a logical understandable thing, it is easy to remember
- Correlated things will be remembered
- Structured things will be remembered

So, one thing you don't understand, there is no relevant information, you can stick, afterwards, there is no finishing, then this information will be rushed away.

(This is why the story is more easily remember than the theory. Because the story is an interesting and more organized structure.)

### 2. Muscle can also remember something

Moreover, we often think that only the brain can remember things, but in fact, the body can also remember things.

The so-called physical feeling, the principle is that when the body performs action, it will bring a pulse to the nerve fibers. The so-called memory neuro circuit of myeloplasts is a current pulse biochastic fiber. Myelination is a layer of insulating substance wrapped outside the neural passage. When practicing to a certain part of the neural path, this part of myelinability will grow. The more exercises, the thicker the insulating layer, the faster the information transmitted in the passage. This is the so-called "muscle memory" effect.

Exactly, things used to memorize are not muscles, but the gods. The more you practice, the more the wires on the body, the more the electric wires, the thicker the wire skin. Therefore, the faster the signal speed is transmitted, the less it is not easily forgotten.

### 3. Human brain will be desperately

Why do we forget some lessons that have been above before, read the contents of the book. There are two reasons:

(1) Information brush

This is because you can imagine, enter the human brain is an endless piece of information. We temporarily store the space of this information. You can make this as a machine's log (the event has an event on the day, but the temporary area is full, it will push the old information, leaving only the recent).

If we are still suspended in the temporary area, put it in the information "sorting" inside, and the storage space that can be relatively saved, such as the brain, the gods.

These messages will be driven away from

(2) Memory loss link

The nerve is a mesh link. In theory, when you move the information, the save time can be longer when it is stored for more than a long time. However, there is no access for too long, and it may be broken to this piece of memory.

You may have experienced some similar situations. There are some skills or knowledge, you are really familiar with a few years, but I haven't used it for a long time. I need to think that I can dig back, but I can be skilled after a while digging.

### The memory of the brain is only one day.

There is a concept of memory law, there is a concept "** Ai Binhaus forgotted curve" ** is often mentioned. \*\*

The psychologist Herman Ai Binhaus is proposed through his own experiment. In this experiment, Ai Pinshaus used some unimedic letters. This curve is obtained by remembering these alphanumeric combinations and checking for forgetting after a series of time intervals.

- After 20 minutes, 42% were forgotten, 58% were remembered.
- After 1 hour, 56% were forgotten, 44% were remembered.
- After 1 day, 74% were forgotten, and 26% were remembered.
- After 1 week, 77% were forgotten, 23% were remembered.
- After 1 month, 79% was forgotten, 21% were remembered.

Therefore, it is usually studied by the scholar of memory. Will hope that we have finished reading the book, after completing the class, try immediately, otherwise it will be easily forgotten.

However, it is actually only described "Timeliness of Storage Areas".

They also said that there are several things, if you want to record these things:

- ㄧ, first of all, these information must "you care", "care" means that it is related to your current goals.
- Second, these information should be stored in a mesh structure. That is
  - (1) You can understand the logic in
  - (2) It may be wrapped with a story
  - (3) These information can be connected to your past experience

So, we have in the past, more teaching, you are more likely to learn teachers, usually use: story, shallow metaphor, even smooth. Let you remember relatively easy.

### We underestimate the importance of muscle memory

School education has a tendency, greatly tilting the importance of "Brain Remember". As for the "experiment" "Practice" class, these courses are easily sacrificed.

Because there is no "experiment" "" practice "lesson, students have no way to experience the memory of the memory of the" experiment "" exercise ". More don't even know the "experiment", "exercise"'s power of "muscle memory".

Therefore, most people are in this long training. Will seriously confuse the "remember" with the "Society". I thought that the "Remember" process can learn one thing. In fact, it is necessary to "learn" the standard, which is a repeated operation.

But repeated operation is that muscles are not brain. And I will further tell the information in the muscle, but instead can break through the filing time limit of the brain memory being brush.

### 记 记 记 记 记 记 记 记

Why can muscle memories are far better than brain memory?

Do you have a similar experience:

No matter what college graduation, you almost forgotten it to the teacher in advance before graduation. However, the business skills learned after the society, but most of them are very skilled. Remember very strong.

When you like a child, like a child, play football, play a table, youth, to assemble the computer, play the game. After growing, although it will slightly, it is often still there.

Why is this?

### 陈 陈 记 记 与 与 非

There is a very famous unbeller patient H.M ..

In 1953, he was subjected to an experimental mental surgery, and some of the sea horses returned to the left and right brains, attempted to slow down his epilepsy. I didn't expect the consequences that could not imagine after surgery. This surgery caused him to never produce new memories. Every day, who said, I can't remember anything.

However, this tragedy for H.M. is a good gift for humans. He agreed to let a neuroscientist, within a few decades, as a research object, explore the mystery of memory.

The most interesting study for H.M. is found. He will forget all kinds of things happen every day. Although the memory ability is lost, it will not lose skills.

Neuroscientists will be called H.M. This long-term memory is called ** statement. H.M. Remember the long-term memory of action skills, called ** non-statement memory \*\*.

I "Think" this matter is not accurate. Because of long-term memories, especially "memory", we will think that it is stored in the brain.

In fact, if you practice the theory of bold wires deliberately practiced.

I think the operation of long-term memory should be as follows:

! [] (iMages / 20211023161457.png)

Regarding the knowledge of "factual" "conceptual", it is presented in the brain.

"Characteristic" knowledge is presented in the presence of nerve and is protected by a marrowser.

This can explain why we will gradually forget the knowledge of statement of memory over time. The skills that practice are hard to forget.

### Exercise system 1 instead of system 2

Of course, this is just my hypothesis. But later I will prove why this theory is relatively close to reality.

In Daniel Connant, "I thought" this book, there is a famous system 1 and system 2 theory.

It is pointed out that the working mechanism of the human brain is divided into system 1 and system 2.

- System 1 representative is reflective intuitive thinking
- System 2 representative is a rational thinking of athletics.

The place where the programmatic knowledge storage call is system 1, while the concept, the fact, meta-knowledge call is in system 2.

In the case of soon, I think it is, pointing out the human awareness and action, and the system 1 is automatically completed, and the system 2 saves electricity. Only when the problem is encountered with the strange environment, the system 2 will clear the change of decision. The system 2 has the final decision.

! [] (iMages / 20211023161647.png)

"I'm slow thinking", mentioning the system 2 has the final decision. This kind of saying seems to be reasonable.

But as an engineer, I feel that this is very uncommon "computer" design logic.

! [] (iMAGES / 20211023161705.PNG)

This is because the speed of decision execution of system 1 is about 15ms, but the speed of system 2 is 500ms or more.

If this speed is drawn as a system diagram, human beings should grow like this:

! [] (iMages / 20211023161724.png)

Our body is automatically operated by a series of fast small subroutines.

There is a theory in the academic community, and human beings should be a rational person (especially financial, economics is assumed), but in fact this may be completely non-fact.

Because if humans are rational people. That whole system, the decision should be dominated by most system 2. However, on the communication execution speed, system 2 is completely dry but system 1.

So when human emotions, the entire person will present such a state, and it is rational.

Humanity is even anxious, even will even create a phenomenon: "Speaking but the brain".

! [] (iMages / 20211023161750.png)

So relatively reasonably, it should be:

Human usually operate in a standby mode, usually, when you encounter problems that have not been resolved in the past, call the system 2 to search for the way to search for possible solutions.

But the so-called rationality is just slow, and the program can be quickly solved quickly.

! [] (iMAGES / 20211023161819.PNG)

Human is essentially a series of unconscious fast systems superimposed, so we usually perform tasks. In fact, it is superimposed by countless systems 1.

! [] (iMages / 20211023161828.png)

When we are talking about human beings, using system 1 is automatically executed, system 2 is usually sleeping. The picture is actually like this:

! [] (iMAGES / 20211023161839.PNG)

System 2 is not the person of the main driving seat, but in the deputy seat, it is mistaken to drive itself. When you encounter a problem, you will go to 1 brakes.

When we deliberately practice, it is often easy to think that we must practice system 2.

! [] (iMAGES / 20211023161856.PNG)

In fact, we should practice system 1.

! [] (iMages / 20211023161913.png)

### The object of deliberate practice should be procedural knowledge priority and write into system 1

In a few years ago, many people who were contained by traditional education, they would laugh at the muscle learning this word. I feel that it is a righteous group.

In fact, this cut angle is the most scientific, and it is easy to depth. Because human beings are running by countless small subroutines. Even the human body will continue to make the loop of the subroutine, grow more and strong, secreted substances make the loop protection layer thicker.

So in the learning strategy. The most correct way should be the primary architecture (bones), after practicing (not easy to forget), and then absorb the factual knowledge (as muscle).

Scenery to learn from the general skills is:

1. First follow the practice of the teacher's unknown learning base
2. After the results are made on the spot. Going home for a short time, practicing three times, also re-copying the results three times
3. Replenish basic knowledge for some parts you don't understand.

Instead of going back, there is a big pile name, and finally, I will make a group sentence, and I don't have a complete.

Because, as a beginner, you can't engage in real-sex knowledge (name) to launch common basic flow (sentence structure) and the necessary limited correct knowledge (what kind of scene use, fine tone and boundary of.

Therefore, I will emphasize the importance of "process" knowledge.
