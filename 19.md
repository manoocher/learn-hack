# Chapter 12 How to learn a new language

In this chapter, we are going to challenge the second problem. Learning languages, before cutting into this topic, learning languages ​​is also considered a very difficult area to crack:

There are quite a few reasons why second language learning is difficult to get started:

- There are so many words, vocabulary and grammar in the language, I don't know where to start
- The use and practice of language really takes a lot of time, making people feel like they don't know when to read
- What you learn in school is out of touch with real life. Dry and tasteless.
- When I went to a cram school by myself, I thought it was not a topic that I was interested in, nor could it be applied to the scene I wanted.
- Most people know how to listen, but not speak. Can read, but not write. I spent more than six to ten years studying in school, but when I actually go to the workplace or go abroad, it is completely useless, and I instantly become dumb.
- Because it is in my own country. Lack of a lot of correct feedback and application scenarios

In this book, we have emphasized in many chapters. The process is difficult to learn, and the result is psychic. Basically, the "target" and the "structure" are misplaced.

## You are not "learning language", you are "learning translation"

As we mentioned in the previous chapter on learning programming languages, the essence of learning programming languages ​​is "automation".

So what is the purpose of learning a "second language"? To put it bluntly, it is "communication". It is necessary to communicate with people from different regions, different cultures and different ways of thinking, solve the problems in front of them, and cooperate to complete projects.

But do you know a scary thing:

Our second language teaching method from more than 100 years ago to now is not to teach "communication", but to teach "translation".

Then the natural learning process and setbacks are completely different.

If we learn a second language in the way of "learning translation studies", then the means:

- The smallest unit is a single word
- Learn from the word
- Learn from articles
- Pursue correct grammar
- In our culture, in the order of speaking, to understand sentences that are assumed to be made by the other party.

So this is the reason why we are miserable when learning a second language:

- all on back
- Memorize a lot of words and scenes that you will never use for 800 years
- Pursue correctness
- How to practice is Chinglish (Chinese-English).

Misplaced goals, painful natural processes, and psychic results.

##Learn language by learning skills

So if you want to learn a language easily, the first thing is to reset the "target".

When you reset the goal, the means, processes, and methods will naturally be completely different.

And "second language communication" is even a skill. It can be completely solved by "learning skills".

If I call out this structure diagram, you will know why I said this:

![](images/20211024113813.png)

And, the technology of learning languages, you would have. It's just that you forgot about him again.

You may even be proficient in a language yourself.

Why do I say this?

If you call out the Dreyfus model, put the level corresponding to the language user

![](images/20211024113824.png)

You'd be surprised how all of us can even be considered proficient. Unlike other fields, the phenomenon of "advanced novice" is quite different.

Then the reader may find it very strange:

Generally speaking, in the field of skill learning, people who specialize in learning one technology often take a lot less time to learn the second technology. Even because they already have their own set of learning methods, the learning process is relatively easy. And even to learn the third and fourth skills, the time required will drop exponentially.

Then why are there so many people who can speak a second language in optics, and the process is so painful.

There are two main reasons:

First, almost all native speakers do not know how they learned their native language. Because our human memory and consciousness are cultivated at almost the same time as learning the mother tongue. Ordinary people even realize that "learning" can actually have a method and routine, and it may even take until the age of 12. Naturally, almost no one knows how their native language is practiced.

Second, the whole school teaches translation studies, not second language communication studies. I was also listening to the live broadcast of the famous English teacher Long Feihu (the author who learned a foreign language in six months), and then I came to know about this. Foreign language teaching in schools is actually a very young technology, only about a hundred years old. And unfortunately, this technology was originally intended for "translation". That is to say, the way we learn a second foreign language in school is not "learning a new language from scratch", but a technique of "translating one language into another". And we don't even know that we are learning "translation studies" rather than "learning new languages" ourselves.

When a field is 100% riddled with wrong teaching materials, and you are taught this method from a young age, you will even be brainwashed by this kind of talk and give up thinking. I think this is the only and correct way to learn a language.

Therefore, in this book, I have been saying that school education is harmful, and this is all well-founded. We actually spent so much time, used the wrong method, tortured ourselves for so many years, and ended up forgetting everything after learning, and even suffered from PTSD (traumatic breakdown) for learning at the end. Isn't that crashing?

## How to learn a second language the right way

### STEP1 Change learning goals and understanding of the process

The reason why the school's second foreign language is outrageous now, you will understand more clearly what is going on after reading these two pictures:

![](images/20211024113840.png)

![](images/20211024113847.png)

1. It is not only the teacher who asks the learner to go straight to the master level from the beginning. Even the demands of learners on themselves are directly to the level of masters. In fact, the learner only needs to learn the level of advanced novice or competent. And ask yourself to make zero mistakes.
2. "Translation Studies" requires learners to start from vocabulary and grammar. The single word is "reading and writing", but the level of advanced novice only needs "listening" and "speaking".
3. The structure of "listening" and "speaking" is essentially different from that of "reading" and "writing". If you don't understand what this means, try recording the entire sentence with a speech transcription software. You will find that there is a huge grammatical and stylistic difference in nature between spoken and written words. But the "translation study" taught in the current school requires us to learn "reading and writing" first and then "listening and speaking". The result is that you learn to read and write, but you cannot hear or speak. Or your "listening" ability and pronunciation are extremely "mechanical" and "weird".
4. The smallest process structure in language learning is sentences, not words. If you start with vocabulary and grammar, most people can't form meaningful sentences, and they will be extremely painful to be adjusted by this process.

So what exactly is the right goal and understanding of the process?

1. Lower your expectations for language learning, from “pronunciation, grammar, word usage, and American accent” to “understanding basic grammar, and being able to use basic sentences to complete simple daily oral and dialogue questions” or “being able to express yourself proficiently. I can use basic grammar to find words and phrases that I don’t understand and correct myself.” Or even more daring and shameless, as long as the other party understands.

1. Start learning from "listening and speaking", not "reading" and "writing".
1. Start learning from "sentences", not "words, grammar, phonetic symbols".

### STEP 2. Use the method of practicing general skills to practice English

Also because there are so many teachers who teach translation studies in the market. If you also buy books on translation studies and come back to study by yourself, it will definitely be a multiplier. So how do we identify teachers who teach in the right way? There's only one key point here, you have to buy books that speak languages ​​"geniuses" in multiple languages.

In fact, these people cannot be regarded as "geniuses". We are often full of advanced imaginations about "speaking" a second language, and we often think that the other person is a proficient person (be able to form their own speaking style and start to write fluently). But in fact, most multilingual geniuses are only proficient in their first mother tongue. It is only for those who are competent or advanced novice in the second foreign language.

But in any case, these people have a relatively general "correct understanding" of language for language learning.

If you really want to recommend it. There are four books I recommend:

1. Long Feihu: "Learn any foreign language in 6 months"
2. Akiyama Yaoping: "The strongest language master in history teaches you to learn 10 languages ​​at a time"
3. Gabriel Wyner: You can chat with people from all over the world: language masters teach you how to master the three keys to quickly become proficient in the languages ​​of various countries, and you will never forget them! (Fluent Forever)
4. You Haoyun: Understand language sense, learn any foreign language painlessly

The main ideas in these four books are all the same. There are only slight differences in individual practice methods and standards.

For example, the six-month key study method mentioned in Long Feihu's book "Learn Any Foreign Language in Six Months" is as follows:

- Week 1: Listening a lot + Mastering the Speaking Toolbox
- Week 2: Hears clearly + can communicate in some words
- Week 3: Bold combinations, use in abundance
- Week 4: 70 glue words are the logic of speaking in English
- Weeks 5 and 6: Work hard to solve 85% of daily English communication
- Weeks 7 and 8: Recognize English word particles and naturally master 75% of the most important rules of English grammar
- Third month: start reading and writing in English
- Fourth month: Integrating into English culture
- Month 5: Expand the use of English and absorb feedback
- Sixth month: Eat every piece of the first work

This method, although rarely used. But it is extremely scientific. Because if we want to learn English quickly, learning English actually requires:

- Step 1: Listen to a lot of English and understand other people's sentences. Copy and learn a lot of sentences. Identify the context of communication. (procedural knowledge)
- Step 2: Supplementary words, scene sentences (factual knowledge)
- Step 3: Master grammar, tenses (conceptual knowledge)
- Step 4: Begin to be able to read cultural relics and correct your English expression ability (metacognition)

And this approach actually seems both familiar and unfamiliar. First, this is the natural way for ordinary people to learn skills, and second, this is essentially how we learn our mother tongue Chinese.

- Step 1: When we were young children, we first listened to the speech of our parents a lot, and finally identified the upper and lower words and key words, and pronounced them. For example, we could only talk about hunger and hunger at the beginning.
- Step 2: When we grow up a little bit, the thesaurus is more. Can tell, hungry, hungry. But when parents hear this, they know that you are hungry and want to eat.
- Step 3: When we are about to go to kindergarten, we will probably be able to say complex sentences such as "I am hungry now, I want to eat fried rice today, my mother bought it for me"
- Step 4: Begin to be able to read storybooks and understand more words and knowledge.

This is a natural way of learning. In fact, in the process, without any pain, we naturally learned a lot of things.

It's just that when we grow up, we have "shame", plus there are too many textbooks for translation studies around us, plus the subject of English, when we study, we are forced to learn (can't specify a teacher, can't specify a range, can't specified duration). Natural multipliers.

### STEP 3. Be patient with yourself

In learning, we have seen the easiest situation to give up halfway: dissatisfaction with our progress and set goals that are too high. Novices usually set the outrageous schedule of three months to reach the "master". Then, the vast majority of people give up after two weeks of hard work.

Indeed, there is no end in sight, and no one has the patience. However, to learn a skill, is there any way to know that you are making progress, and how long it will take you to practice it.

Actually there is a way. Take programmers, for example. Programmers themselves are language learners, but we learn "programming languages".

What's special about this language is that most people are self-taught or semi-self-taught (led by a teacher). Moreover, it is a skill that can be quickly searched on the Internet to obtain examples to copy and learn, and the computer can also immediately feedback the correct grammar skills after inputting the results. And what engineers learn is "language" (programming language).

In this line, for beginners to masters, generally speaking, there are already skill level standards and required time.

![](images/20211024114033.png)

And if you put programming languages ​​side by side with language learning. You will find that children learn their mother tongue first language at the same pace after they have basic cognition (12 months).

![](images/20211024114047.png)

Children basically understand basic grammar at the age of 2-3, and can use basic sentences to complete simple daily oral dialogue problems. Then at the age of 4-6, I will constantly ask my parents why.

Then around elementary school you can start to develop a speaking style and start writing simple essays.

So learning to "know" a language is not a long way off, but a maximum of 12-18 months (advanced novice). This is also the roughly common time course and progress of those multi-language geniuses who learn languages.

### STEP 4. Customize your self-taught language experience with the methods in this book

Since "communicating in a second language" is a skill. Then you can also redesign your learning process in this way:

STEP 1: Define your short-term learning goals (could be a restaurant scenario, or reading a technical journal scenario)
STEP 2: Write down the gaps, complaints, troubles between your current situation and the goal you want to achieve
STEP 3: Dig out the keywords, key questions, key methods, and key processes you really need
STEP 4: Buy a lot of books and find the process.
STEP 5: Construct the sentence library you need, and find a teacher or teaching material that can pronounce correctly or give correct feedback. He listened to you and practiced it several times.
STEP 6: Swap the words in the sentence to practice the sentence and context. From small routines to big routines

This repetition can quickly reach your desired language learning goals.

Here are two more learning tips:

1. If you need to reduce the burden of memory and improve learning efficiency, you can consider buying storytelling books for children and middle school students. The speed of pictures is much faster than the absorption of words.
2. If you need to learn a foreign language for your professional skills, it will actually be faster. Because you can quickly infer the context from the target article, so as to understand the unfamiliar words in it faster.
