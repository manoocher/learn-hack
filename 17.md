# How to learn a subject by yourself

We mainly talked about a few topics before: learning the framework from the teacher, and sorting out the key points from the content taught by the teacher.

But there are not so many good teachers in life, or those good teachers never coincide with your time and place, and you will never have the chance to take their classes in your life.

Or, this knowledge and technology is too new, and the framework technology really exists, but it may be scattered everywhere in various fields. Learning from various sources (books, courses, articles) is difficult to organize, what if the scope feels infinite?

Is there any efficient way. In fact, there really is. I have won many fields with this self-study framework.

In English, the actual English word is not "Self-Learning", but "Self-Taught" (self-taught)

What I want to teach you here is a set of "how to teach yourself" framework.

## Create your own "Algebra Workbook"

In 2015, I had a class "Intro to Growth Hack" in Taiwan that was very popular. The word Growth Hack translated into Chinese is called growth hacking. It is a way to achieve performance growth with various technical tools on the Internet. Because this course was very new, there was not much material in the Chinese world at that time, but it was a technology that everyone was flocking to.

2015 coincided with the opportunity when I left the United States and returned to Taiwan. Friends in the technical circle know that I have dabbled in this technology when I was in the United States, and I hope to share it. Unexpectedly, this class was crowded.

Originally the first version was only shared with friends in the technical circle. There are many proper nouns.

Later, after sharing one or two sessions, a friend asked me if I could adapt this technology to a course that ordinary people can understand and understand in seconds. I tried to make a version for ordinary people. Unexpectedly, the road of teaching has been ignited since then. . .

Because this subject was new and popular at the time, and my course at that time was understandable in seconds. Even though I only knew how to tell the story at the time, I couldn't resist everyone's enthusiasm.

In the end, because the class was so popular, I had to sell tickets twice a month, with 100 people per session. Every time a ticket is released, it is instantly killed within a few minutes. Within half a year, there were 1,500 people who heard the speech.

The book ended up being turned into a book "Growth Hack Do This" a year later, which won the Gold Book Award not long after it was published.

Why can I study this new knowledge thoroughly and explain it in a simple and easy-to-understand manner in a short period of time (1-2 years)? The key lies in my problem-breaking method and note-taking technique.

In my mind, this class is no different from the "Algebra Workbook" I wrote in college before (a guide book for the whole class to get 100 points in the algebra test).

Back in 2013, I saw the word Growth Hack online. I also wanted to learn, but at that time, I couldn't find a book on the Internet that would provide a way to systematically study this subject. Turning over and over is an inexplicable English article. Even if there were some marketers at the time who did Growth Hack's online courses, I felt that the quality was poor, and they didn't answer the questions I wanted to know at all.

So as an engineer. I plan to study this subject myself.

After all, most wild programmers are almost self-taught to learn to program. And most of the problems in the programming world, many of which are new and developing in real time, don't have many books. Most of us also use the articles one by one, extract the key points, do them repeatedly, and apply them in our daily work to accumulate capabilities.

In the book Building a Superhuman Brain, I also share the process of how I learned financial report analysis from zero. In this book, I'll use the Growth Hack theme and demonstrate it again.

The method steps are:

### **Step 1: Write down all your curiosity and confusion about the field (what is it? and why is it important?)**

At that time, the most primitive and basic first question was, "What is Growth?"

I found a lot of basic information, and cross-over and overlapping look. In Stanford's 2014 edition of How to Start a Startup, I heard the class talk about the most basic concepts of Growth. (I am also a novice, I think the most reasonable and finishing explanation)

![](images/20211024113407.png)

> Conversion - Churn = Growth

It is pointed out that growth does not refer to performance growth alone, but refers to improvement in two directions:

1. Increase the conversion rate (promote the order rate of strangers)
2. Reduce churn (reduce customer churn)

This explanation is very acceptable to me. Because I thought that Growth literally meant growth, and I didn't expect to reduce the churn rate as well.

Next, my second question in this field is "What is Growth Hack?"

I found the answer on Wikipedia:

> Growth Hack (growth hacker) According to the definition on Wikipedia (Wikipedia), it can be simply translated as follows: "Technological entrepreneurial team, through data analysis and quantitative indicators, a market operation technology used to promote products".

Translated in vernacular, it is

> It is difficult to do online marketing. Unlike physical stores, you can physically attract customers. You can see the reaction of customers shopping for products. You can also ask why you don’t want to choose and leave. However, these things cannot be done when opening an online store, so we use technical means to monitor customer behavior, help customers find the products they want to buy when they have questions, and solve their doubts when they come to the store. It can also detect any issues that are popping out (causing customers to leave) on your own store.

That is to say, it is relatively easy to do business in the store on weekdays. You will quickly know whether the customer buys it or not, and there are ways to deal with the reason on the spot. But to open an online store, these actions are very difficult. We need to learn a technology that can be applied to online stores, monitor sales performance, and automate and deploy on a large scale whether it is to improve performance or reduce customer churn.

### **Step 2: Find the most frequent keywords or scenarios (which means this is the key backbone of the discipline)**

Searching around Growth Hack, there is a set of words AARRR that keeps appearing.

So I went to check **"What the hell is AARRR?"**

![](images/20211024113426.png)

I found out that AARRR means the five stages of the customer consumption life cycle:

> Acquisition (user acquisition) Activation (user activation) Retention (user retention) Revenue (expand revenue) Referral (recommended use)

Then, the next question is, why is it so important to know "AARRR"? \*\*

After reading a lot of articles, I found that when we usually do marketing, we originally imagined AARRR like this, thinking that if we spend a lot of money on advertising, customers will come in:

![](images/20211024113435.png)

But this is what happens when you actually do business. Spend a lot of money on advertising, but customers do not pay, and there is no repurchase rate:

![](images/20211024113445.png)

That's why we took the time to improve this problem, and Growth Hack is the technology to improve this problem on the website.

Here comes the problem. **How ​​do we do it? **

### **Step 3: What is XX? Why is it important? How to do it? How to do it 10 times faster? **

So next, I put forward the same question cycle for each of the five links of AARRR:

### **Acquisition**

- What is "Acquisition"?
- Why is "Acquisition" important?
- How to do "Acquisition"?
- How to do it many times faster than doing "Acquisition" for the first time?

### **Activation**

- What is "Activation"?
- Why is "Activation" important?
- How to do "Activation"?
- How to make it many times faster than doing "Activation" for the first time?

### **Retention**

- What is "Retention"?
- Why is "Retention" important?
- How to do "Retention"?
- How to make it many times faster than doing "Retention" for the first time?

### **Revenue**

- What is "Revenue"?
- Why is "Revenue" important?
- How to do "Revenue"?
- How to make it many times faster than doing "Revenue" for the first time?

### **Referral**

- What is "Referral"?
- Why is "Referral" important?
- How to do "Referral"?
- How to make it many times faster than doing "Referral" the first time?

## **Step 3: Skip topics that are too difficult**

After some searching and researching on the web. Found

The two themes of "Acquisition" and "Revenue" are very difficult to simply study and summarize.

The former "Acquisition" involves the characteristics and delivery of each advertising channel. The latter "Revenue" involves price positioning design.

All are great knowledge. I got lost as I delved.

So I just gave up. Let’s delve into limited topics first:

- Activation (user activation)
- Retention
- Referral (recommended)

Said to be limited, in fact, these three themes are not small.

Just these three themes, with clear scope, systematic tools, and methodology.

After some more searching and research, I found:

- Activation, which I can solve with Landing Page
- Retention (user retention), essentially I can use the concept of Onboarding to solve
- Referral (recommended), you can use the NPS tool to debug customer satisfaction and recommendation index.

After getting these three topics, the core architecture of the entire Growth Hack is almost done.

As for the problem of Acquisition and Revenue, it can be solved with money and external forces.

So I concentrated my firepower and tried to find a way to find out the procedural knowledge of these three topics, "how to do it", and try to practice it at least once or twice.

## **Step4: Find the 10x faster way**

I still remember that when I first learned the tool of Landing Page, I held meetings, debates, and practical work with my colleagues in the company for a full month. What happened to the boss at the end. How can it take so long to make a page for a month.

However, Landing Page involves brand positioning and customer core pain points.

Sometimes, companies get lost while walking, and new employees don’t even know what problems the company was supposed to solve, and now the strongest problem is to solve.

Some programmers and designers only care about whether the page looks good when creating a website, and they don't care whether the words written on the page can increase the purchase rate, directly hitting the user's pain point and attracting orders.

However, you can't fight like this for a month every time you do Landing Page. We have other Landing Pages to do. So I was researching, is there a faster way to do Landing Page. What exactly is the principle of Landing Page.

Later, I really let me figure out a Landing Page rapid writing framework. (For how to do this, see the book "Lightning Development")

The time for me to do a Landing Page has dropped from one month to two weeks, to two days, to two hours.

## **Step 5: Understand the underlying principles**

Then I will mention the knowledge of Retention again. Retaining users and generating repurchase behavior is a very difficult science.

I bought dozens of books about repurchase, and every book told me to be customer-oriented, so that repurchase can occur.

Doesn't this amount to fucking bullshit?

I thought this was a dead end.

**Customers leave because they don't know how to operate and don't feel value**

Later, in a blog post of Silicon Valley guru Brian Balfour, I mentioned a piece of data from when he was working on a product at Hubspot. To mention a bloody stat:

- 30% leave the product "without feeling value"
- 30% of people leave the product "don't know how to operate"
- 10% leave because of "product failure"
- Only 10% leave because they think other competitors are better

![](images/20211024113508.png)

I just found out that the most direct problem of customers leaving is that

> 60% of people don't understand the product and leave because they don't feel the value.

### **Retention is the key to building customer habits**

When I was researching the knowledge of Retenion, another keyword kept popping up in my search results.

The word is "habit".

> To get customers to repurchase, let them develop consumption habits!

Seeing this realization, don't you think it's just another fucking nonsense?

But it touched another experience of mine.

At the time, I was working in a Silicon Valley bento delivery company that delivered to your door in ten minutes. There was a bottleneck in sales for a while, and our Data Team sent a group of Interns to visit customers: Ask customers, what are our priorities?

The answer was quite shocking to us, and customers had a ton of complaints about our service:

- tastes bad
- Too slow
- The driver has a bad attitude when delivering meals

…etc. After hearing these complaints, we were so ashamed that we wanted to commit suicide.

However, these customers are still willing to continue to use it. We are very question: why?

Intern said: Because these users are used to it, because the service is very convenient:

- Although the advertisement claims to arrive in 10 minutes, the customer's inner expectation is that they can arrive within 30 minutes at the latest.
- It's not a delicious bento, but it's "eatable". For a meal of 10 bucks, this quality is ok.
- The customer has a worst-case expectation, as long as the product lives above the bottom line.

Later, when we were collecting data internally, we found that all our frequent customers, as long as they have more than 5 consecutive consumption records within two weeks, this person is very likely to become our frequent customers. So, we did a marketing activity called 5by5. The content of the activity is as follows: the first order is half price (5 yuan), as long as you spend, we will give you another half price coupon. Trial prices within five consecutive times.

Originally, RD Team was dubious about this strategy. However, our service quality has not changed, and we only did this activity, and the sales performance has soared.

From this example, I found that the key point of Retention is to establish the expectations of customers and develop their habits.

Even their own services cannot improve the quality in a short period of time. You can also do this: let the customer feel that there is a pattern that sucks, and everything is according to his heart's expectations. If there is a part in this process that makes him feel that he has done a particularly good job, it will be surprisingly good. The client will feel so happy and want to repeat it. Do this several times in a row, and customers will feel that your product is better than expected.

## **Step 6: Porting off-the-shelf framework methods from other industry improvements**

I probably understand the underlying principle of Retention. The key point is:

- Let customers know how to use it from the beginning, and then feel the value
- Let customers build consumption habits

But the question is, how to do it?

I really want to break my head on this question, I Google "Retention" and "Onboarding" on the Internet and can't find a useful method.

Made me feel very irritable. Searching for "Onboarding" in particular, also pops up a bunch of stuff I don't need. All search results in the HR industry.

Google can't find information so frustrating, it's still rare for me. So I was thinking, why are all the search results in the HR field that pop up.

Only then did I find out that "Onboarding" (boarding), the word itself means "new users, new customer guidance". And this word is "borrowed" from the HR field. The word was originally used to refer to "new employee induction".

I slapped my forehead. What am I stupid. No industry is more focused on retaining new people than HR.

Because it takes a lot of recruitment costs for a company to recruit a suitable employee, and if the new person does not adapt, they will leave soon, and the recruitment cost will be thrown into the water. If the newcomer has been unable to adapt to the new environment, unable to generate recognition, unable to learn basic knowledge, unable to start the business. A huge loss for the company.

So I went to Amazon and bought a few Onboarding books, and sure enough, I found a reference method in the Onboarding book. The Onboarding framework I invented later was a framework that was adapted from several books on employee onboarding.

This Onboarding framework has also been applied to various fields by me, and it is a powerful method to quickly integrate newcomers into unfamiliar environments.

Especially in the field of websites, there are no obvious mistakes just going up. But it just doesn't work. But it always takes half a year and a year to figure out user habits. At this point, I don't know how many customers have been lost.

After we use this method, we can polish the user's line to a silky-smooth experience even before going online.

## **The framework of "self-teaching"**

This chapter is actually:

1. Write down all your curiosity and confusion about the field
2. Google or buy a lot of books to satisfy these curiosity and doubts. Find important keywords and domain structures that keep recurring.
3. Find ways to do it (procedural knowledge).
4. Understand the underlying principles (supplement facts and conceptual knowledge).
5. Redesign the method and framework to be 10 times faster (metacognition adjusts its own approach).
6. Repeat this cycle

the specific display method.

At the beginning, many friends would "Intro to Growth Hack". This course is easy to understand, and the book is also very easy to understand. In fact, it was a notebook I wrote to "church" myself when I was researching.

And my book "Building Superhuman Learning" is an oversized "learning" framework that I created for myself.
