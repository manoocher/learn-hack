# Chapter 2: Establishing a visible learning goal (but against it)

In the previous chapter, we introduced the "learning" we cognracted, in fact, is divided into a different A game (fill the blank memory game) and B game (RPG game).

However, our daily "Psychics" feeling in learning (sometimes exhausted hard, but sometimes there is no heart to join the will, if there is a sense of helping, what is more than half of the game, when playing two games, use the wrong strategy Directation caused by clearance.

We are used to customs clearance with a game of A game, to some extent, school education has its responsibility. But deep, there is another part of our own reasons:

\> Our human beings are not good at playing a large unlimited game.

When a game is big to go to the target, when there is no rule, we usually don't know how to start, dismantle or even go.

So unconsciously hiding the operation technique of the A game (the target, rules, and points of the game are very clear.) As the safe port.

However, let's go with the strategy in the A game to play B game. We have been unseasive process and results, disgusting pain.

How do you crack this problem? This is actually the way of this book's superman learning framework to solve, introduced the method:

1. Find your own learning goals
2. Reverse dismantling of the target into a list
3. Bai Baxi advance

## step 1: Find your own learning goals

The readers here may be caveted. Why do you want to set "learning goals"? Not "teacher" or "book", do you learn?

Non-also. This is not called learning, but "take practice", that is, a person caught your hand with you running in the game.

In mostth, you will feel boring. Because people pull your hand, you don't know what you are doing. And it's time for a long time, you will feel that this process is bored, I want to "get offline".

- We don't know why you have to do this
- What is the purpose of doing this is for what is for long-term goals or short-term goals?
- Do you have improved after you?

So just shake.

However, this is not to say that people are not practicing your hand. Because if you want to participate in a game, this game is huge and there is no guide. Without the old hands, the novice is like falling into the undead jungle, the feeling is even more awkward.

Then what do we do?

The answer is to set up your own state diagram, instrument version, task table.

Just starting to read the readers may not feel that they don't have a goal? We are often do not have a target (do not know the end point) in the game, and even only one blur direction: becoming strong. But you can play Tianjin taste.

Where is the difference between the two?

The answer is that there are several mechanisms in real life in the game: level, skill trees, points, leaderboards.

In a game, we can know what we have made by these mechanisms. What kind of feedback has been done, and I have gotten the progress, I have been in my own confirmation, security A sense of accomplishment.

You may feel that it is bored when you repeated or practiced a skill, stupid. But in fact, we have always repeatedly do the same action in the game. But we are not tired.

The key difference between these two things is:

- In the school, the goal is not you set, you just be dragged in the ground. Once Human feels that the goal is too far away, I don't know what I am doing, and I will naturally want to leave this game. Or put it into another game you can win.
- In entertainment game, at least we know that the operation A will get B, know your current state. The next hour I know what I am doing. And you can see your own status, and what efforts are needed in the next level.

You have to feel interesting this game and can be worked, at least in the game

1. I feel that I am getting closer and closer to the original idea.
2. At a glance, confirm that you have not deviated from the channel.
3. I have been unlocked the small task of the task list and obtain the upgrade.

So whether your goal is to learn language, learning programming, and even just learn "learning". You have to have at least one goal. This goal is even specific. For example, I can learn Japanese in Japanese restaurant to learn to be a simple website. Twenty times fast reading, etc.

### step 2. Reverse dismantling against the target

There is a goal to this way. is very important. The reason is that the so-called "task list" is completely dependent on "Game Target".

The reader can hear here a bit can't come. "In the face of a journey that you have not playing, the visible progress will be moved slowly."

This matter seems to be a heaven. I haven't experienced these processes, and how do I dismantle the target to be visible?

Although this problem is difficult, it is not no way to solve. Even the series of readers may have seen me demonstration. This solution method is reversed:

The answer is: back.

To build a superman series, the most often there is a problem, it is back.

1. Write down your current state and want to reach the target.

2. Draw a straight line. And on this line, write down your difficulties and complaints for this matter.

! [] (images / 20211026103042.png)

3. Next, these difficulties and complaints will turn into one topic, then classify.
4. Finally, you can get a roughly viable solicity order and strategy.

For example, learning this topic, the problem we may encounter is:

- Studying things always can't stand up
- I am very tired when learning things
- No time learning
- Beginning to learn soon
- afraid to find a bad teacher
- bad teachers are very bored
- Unable to practice
- deliberately practice can't see your progress
- After reading, I don't want to sleep, I will forget it.
- often lost the goal
- ...

In turn, it will become a positive topic.

- Find ways to make it easier to remember
- Find a very easy way to learn things
- Squiring your own trip, find zero-time learning
- Find how to let yourself learn high
- Find way to pick a good teacher
- Find even a bad teacher, you still have a way, at least harvest at least a solution
- Find the key reason and method of continuous exercise
- Find way to let yourself seek your progress
- How can I easily, remember most of the way?
- often lost the goal

(This is actually the main backbone of this book, is it a very moving?

Then put these problems actually tag. So the above forward topic will become

- Memory method
- Mini method
- save time
- Addiction method
- Pick a teacher's method
- Express the teacher's class content, tough extrusion of dry goods
- Method for continuous practice
- See how you progress
- Reading method
- Grasp the goal and stick to the goal

Then we re-sort these topics

It will become:

- Establish a correct goal
- save time, save time
- Find a teacher
- Self-study
- Continuous exercise, progress

It will get a fuzzy big direction and a small list.

### 大 国 翔 平 也 原 原 原 原

Here, of course, you will seem to be a little vague. But go to this direction, I really don't have a good direction. At least others are lost in the sea. You have already hopped over there.

#### The back of genius has its own list

Write here, I want to introduce a case. Da Guxiangping.

The US duty wander League player Da Gu Xiangping is a very rare casting "two-knife" player in the modern duty rod. As a pitcher, Da Guxiang is still the 165km / h surprising ball speed of the Japanese professional local player, which is a large change of the ball. It is also a player who also has excellent long-playing ability, 27 amazing baseball talents Amazed.

Seeing the achievements of Shanggu Xiangping, you will feel that he is a genius. But is the case behind? I believe that Da Guxiang has a talent. But more critical is that he knows how to play with this game:

The Da Vali is at a high day. In order to hone himself, he has done such a plan. He became a "eight big ball" as the final goal, dismantled into 8 directions, 64 feasible and manual direction and methods.

Through this 64 grid, he makes his goals very accurate, you can gradually master the progress and results we think that it is impossible to master (such as luck, etc.).

We often think that genius is lucky, relying on teacher. In fact, it is not only the big valley, Suzuki is also its own goal and list.

(https://www.businesstoday.com.tw/article/category/80407/post/201703020015/%E5%BE%9E%E9%88%B4%E6%9C%A8%E4%B8%80 %E6% 9C% 97% E5% 9C% 8B% E5% B0% 8F% E4% BD% 9C% E6% 96% 87% 20% E7% 9C% 8B% E8% A6% 8B% E4% BB% 96% E7% 9A% 84PDCA% E9% AD% 82)

These achievements are not possible to be "take practice", leg to the achievements of the seniors, and the teacher accumulated. It is not a result of luck and mess. You want to grow up through learning, at least a goal is to be gradually "floating".

The benefits of the reverse law are actually letting you have a way before you have not played the game, you can roughly remove the "unlimited game" level. Even the following benefits:

1. The target can be greatly shortened, concentrated, and even excavated this game's true key point
2. No longer a headless flies, and will go to the last goal. The most fear of us will be lost in the direction, but the way to take the way is the most often occurring in any case or study. Through the positioning "biggest pothole", we can pretend to be in the potential cave, first filled the pit or even a bridge, so that the whole process will become very smooth.
3. The progress visualization. Because the original trouble is endless. And when we write questions or troubles forward, this number is in an instant, becoming a limited problem, or even 10-30 or less. People are very real, if this goal is too far, encounter problems with continuous increase and unknown synchronization during the solution, soon it is easy to give up. This method allows you to see the number required by the solution, and sort it according to your own priority or resolution. When this is not declined, you can quickly feel your progress. It can even begin to predict that the time required is determined.
4. Once the problem becomes small. The difficulty is reduced. You can even use a rough direct way. The riot is directly in line with our human built-in learning behavior. You have begun to know how to copy tits, copy others's existing practices, and no longer rewrite the wheel. And because of the screen, you can continue to feel your progress quickly, form a positive cycle.
5. The most critical is that when you are small, the problem is smaller, and the demolition is short. The answer to many questions is easy to find the method, even each "in" problem, there is a book or a class to quickly solve these problems. This is more than yourself there.

Of course, the 64th grid of Da Vali seems very powerful. I think, when you first remove your goals, you may not be able to stay once. But I also believe this table, nor the first time he makes it. Instead, after a few years, constantly modified, adjusted.

However, in the beginning of learning, set a goal, and then reverse the progress. It is undoubtedly allow you to get from the original unlimited far target game, and instantly reducing a relatively small game, making it easy to enter the positive cycle.

## orthographic excavation to find true key factors

On this topic, many people often think that they have a bad ability. It is because "Memory is not enough" "memory is very laborious", so it will lead to "learning will not". However, after the retrieval method is classified, it is more important to see that the true key reason is the target establishment and progress visualization.

Once the target is right, the demolition is small.

We are likely to suddenly solve the level that I have been caught in your own, find a golden key, thus digging out the real keyword or process behind it, quickly unpacking 50 ~ 80%, you are currently being plagued. question.
