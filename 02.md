# Chapter 2: Establishing Visible Learning Objectives (but the other way around)

In the last chapter, we introduced what we perceive as "learning", which is actually divided into different A games (fill-in-the-blank memory games) and B games (RPG games).

However, our daily "psychic" feeling about learning (sometimes we try our best to get twice the result with half the effort, but sometimes it is really helpful to learn with half the effort), most of it comes from playing two games, using the wrong strategy caused by the clearance.

We are accustomed to using the A game method to pass the level, and to some extent, school education has its own responsibility. But deep down, there is another part of our own reasons:

\> We humans are not good at playing a large infinite game.

When a game is so big that the goal is endless and there are no rules, we usually don't know how to start, disassemble or even continue.

So unconsciously hide from the operation method of the A game (the goal, rules, and points of the A game are very clear.) as a safe haven.

However, once you go back and use the strategy from game A, play game B. Again, we are disgusted and miserable with the uncertain process and outcome.

How to solve this problem? This is actually what the Superman Learning Framework in this book aims to solve. The methods introduced:

1. Find your learning goals
2. Reverse disassembly of the target into a task list
3. 100 times faster

## Step 1: Find your own learning goals

The reader may be confused here. Why set a "learning goal" in the first place? Isn't it what the "teacher" or "book" teaches, so we just follow it?

Not also. This is not called learning, but "training", that is, a person grabs your hand and leads you to run in the game.

Most of the time, you will feel bored. It's because people are holding your hand to practice, and you don't know what you're doing at all. And after a long time, you will still feel that this process is so boring, and you want to sleep "offline".

- We don't know why we do this
- What is the purpose of doing this (whether it is a long-term goal or a short-term goal)
- Did you make any progress after finishing it?

So shaken.

However, this is not to say that it is not good for people to hold your hand straps. Because if you want to play a game, the game is huge and there are no guiding goals. Without an experienced hand, a novice is like falling into an endless jungle, which makes you want to log out.

So what are we going to do?

The answer is to set up your own state diagrams, dashboards, task sheets.

At first, readers may not feel that they have no goals and it will be okay? In the game, we usually do task upgrades without a goal (don't know the end point), and even we have only one vague direction: to become stronger. But you can have fun.

What is the difference between the two?

The answer is that there are several mechanisms in the game that do not exist in real life: levels, skill trees, points, leaderboards.

In a game, with the help of these mechanisms, we can know exactly what efforts we have made, what feedback we have received, and what progress we have made. There is always a sense of certainty and security that we are moving forward. , a sense of achievement.

You might find it boring and silly to repeat or practice a skill at school. But in fact, in the game, we sometimes do the same action repeatedly. But we never tire of it.

The key difference between these two things is that:

- In school, the goal is not set by you, you are just dragged to the ground and rushing. And once humans feel that the goal is too far away from themselves, they donâ€™t know what they are doing, and they keep losing, they will naturally want to leave the game. Or into another game that you can win.
- In recreational games, at least we know that operation A will get B, and we know our current state. The next hour I know what I'm doing. And you can see your current state and what effort you need to go to the next level.

You have to find the game interesting and manageable, at least in the game all the time

1. Be able to feel that you are getting closer to your original intended goal.
2. Check your dashboard at a glance and make sure you are not deviating from the course
3. You can always unlock the small tasks of the task list and get upgrades.

So whether your goal is to learn a language, learn to program, or even just learn to "learn". You have to have at least one goal. The goal even has to be specific. For example, learn Japanese that can order food in a Japanese restaurant, learn to make a simple website. Read twenty times faster and so on.

### Step 2. Reverse disassembly against the target

There is a goal for this method. is very important. The reason is that our meaningful "task list" depends entirely on the "game objective" to generate the design.

Readers may be a little confused when they hear this: "Faced with an unknowable journey that you have never played, break down your goals into visible progress and move forward slowly."

This thing sounds like a fantasy. If you have not gone through these processes, how can you break down the goals into feasible and visible progress?

Although this problem is difficult, it is not impossible to solve. Even series readers may have seen me demonstrate. The solution to this problem is the reverse:

The answer is: the reverse.

In the creation of the Superman series, the most common problem-solving method is to do it in reverse.

1. Write down where you are now and what you want to achieve.

![](images/20211026103024.png)

2. Draw the next straight line. And above and below this line, write down all your difficulties and complaints about this matter.

![](images/20211026103042.png)

3. Next, turn these difficulties and complaints into topics, and then categorize them.
4. Finally, you can get a roughly feasible problem solving sequence and strategy.

For example, to study this topic, we may encounter problems such as:

- I can't remember what I've learned
- Tired while studying
- no time to study
- Lost interest soon after starting study
- Fear of finding a bad teacher
- Bad teachers are boring in class
- Unable to keep practicing
- Deliberately practicing without seeing your own progress
- I fell asleep after reading, but I forgot after reading it
- Often lose sight of goals while studying
- ......

In turn, it becomes a positive subject and it becomes

- Find easy ways to remember what you've learned
- Find easy ways to learn things
- Organize your own itinerary and find piecemeal time to study
- Find ways to get yourself high learning
- Find out how to pick a good teacher
- If you find a bad teacher, you still have a way to get on and at least gain a little solution
- Find out the key reasons and how to keep practicing
- Find ways to see your progress visibly
- How to read with ease and remember most of the ways
- Often lose sight of goals while studying

(This is actually the main content of this book, does it make you very excited)

Then actually TAG these questions. So the above positive problem will become

- Memorization method
- Labor saving method
- time saving method
- Addictive method
- How to choose a teacher
- Quickly forward the content of the teacher's class and forcefully squeeze out the dry goods
- Method of continuous practice
- Ways to see your own progress
- How to read
- The way to grasp the goal and stick to it

Then we reclassify the issues

will become:

- Set the right goal
  --Time saving, time saving
- find a teacher
- Self-study
- Continue to practice and improve

You get vague directions and small lists.

### Otani Shohei is also using the mandala method is also similar

At this point, of course you'll be argue that these lists still look a little vague. But going in this direction, it really even has a good direction. At least others are lost in the endless sea. You've at least swam that way.

#### Behind the genius, everyone has their own list

Writing here, I would like to introduce a case. Otani Shohei.

Major League Baseball player Shohei Otani is a rare player in modern professional baseball who is a double-blind player. As a pitcher, Shohei Otani not only has an amazing ball speed of 165km/h, which is still the official record of local players in Japan's professional baseball, and has a dramatic change of the ball. As a hitter, he also has excellent long-play ability. Tsk amazed.

Seeing Shohei Otani's achievements, you would think he was a genius. But is that really the case? I believe Otani Shohei is talented. But more importantly, he knew how to play his game:

When Otani Shohei was a freshman in high school, in order to hone himself, he once made such a plan. He took himself as the ultimate goal of becoming the "Nominated One of the Eight Major Pelletizing Groups", and disassembled it into 8 directions and 64 feasible implementation directions and methods.

![](images/20211023164123.png)

Through these 64 squares, he makes his goals very, very precise, and he can gradually grasp the progress and achievements (such as luck, etc.) that we thought impossible to grasp.

We tend to think that genius is based on luck and teachers. In fact, not only Otani Shohei, but Suzuki Ichiro also has his own goals and lists.

![](images/20211026104531.png)

(https://www.businesstoday.com.tw/article/category/80407/post/201703020015/%E5%BE%9E%E9%88%B4%E6%9C%A8%E4%B8%80%E6% 9C%97%E5%9C%8B%E5%B0%8F%E4%BD%9C%E6%96%87%20%E7%9C%8B%E8%A6%8B%E4%BB%96%E7% 9A%84PDCA%E9%AD82%)

None of these achievements can be "led and practiced", but only by the achievements accumulated by seniors and teachers. It's not a random result of luck. If you want to grow through learning, you must at least set a goal before you can gradually "float".

The advantage of the reverse method is that you can roughly pull out the level direction of "Infinite Game" by yourself before you have played the game. It even comes with the following benefits:

1. The goal can be shortened, concentrated and simplified, and even the real key points of the game can be discovered
2. No more headless flies, and must go to the final goal. What we fear most when going forward is losing our way, but taking a fork in the road is what happens most often when doing things or studying. By locating the "largest pothole", we can preemptively turn over the possible pothole, fill the hole first or even lay a bridge, so that the whole process becomes very smooth.
3. Progress visualization. Because the original troubles are endless. And when we write down the problems or worries in reverse, the number instantly goes from endless to limited, or even less than 10-30. People are very realistic. If this goal is too far away, and in the process of solving the problem, you will encounter the problem of continuous increase and unknown time to solve the problem, and it will be easy to give up quickly. This method allows you to directly see the number of problems you need to solve and sort them according to your own priority or ability to solve. When this number of unsolved problems drops, you can quickly feel your progress. You can even start predicting the time needed to determine it.
4. Once the problem gets smaller and shorter. The difficulty is reduced. You can even solve problems in a crude and direct way. Roughness fits directly into our human built-in learning behavior. You start to take shortcuts, copy what others are doing, and stop reinventing the wheel. And because you take shortcuts, you can continue to feel your progress quickly, forming a positive cycle.
5. And the most important thing is that when you dismantle the problem smaller, the dismantling is shorter. The answers to many questions are easy to find, and there is even a book or a course for each "medium" question that can quickly solve these problems. It's a lot quicker than just fooling around there.

Of course, Shohei Otani's 64 blocks look great. I think, when you dismantle your goal for the first time, you may not be able to get it right the first time. But I also believe that this watch is not the first version he made. It has been revised and adjusted over several years.

However, at the beginning of the study, first set a goal, and then reverse the writing progress. Undoubtedly, you can instantly reduce the difficulty of the original infinite target game to several relatively small games, so that it is easy to enter a positive loop.

## Iterative mining to find the real key factor

In the subject of learning, many people often think that the reason for their poor learning ability. It is because of "insufficient memory" and "memory is very laborious", which leads to "can't learn". However, after classifying and mining through the reverse method, we can actually see that the real key reason is the establishment of goals and the visualization of progress.

Once the target is right, the demolition is small.

It is very likely that we will suddenly unlock the level that has been stuck in the past, find a golden key, and then dig out the real keywords or processes behind the whole piece, and quickly solve 50~80% of the large piece that you are currently troubled by question.
