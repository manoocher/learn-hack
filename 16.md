# Class (2) How to listen to a class

In the previous chapter, we talked about learning routines and frameworks with good teachers.

But the thing is, sometimes the lessons you want to learn

- Not a workshop for teaching routines
- The field is too new, only personal experience sharing
- Teachers only know how to impart knowledge by way of speeches

What to do then?

This is what happens most often when we are in class. And when it comes to this kind of class, it is usually a headache:

- Teachers are boring in class
- I don't understand most of what the teacher said in class
- Most of what the teacher talks in class is not what I want to listen to
- I didn't have time to copy the teacher's blackboard writing in class. Should I concentrate on listening or writing notes?
- When I wrote a note and I went home to sort it out, I found that I couldn't understand it. After a while, the whole thing is finally forgotten.
- I don't have time to take notes when I get home. I don't remember what happened at the end.

How can these situations be resolved?

## Tip **1: Go to class with questions**

Why do you feel boring about a course. There are usually two reasons:

(1) The teacher really doesn't know how to teach, there are problems with rhythm, way of telling, and the essence of content

(2) What you teach is not what you want to use, and your goals and levels do not match the curriculum

Also, most of the courses cannot be fast-forwarded. In the tens of minutes before class, which is also the tens of minutes when we are most motivated to study, if we can’t hear what we want, or feel that we have lost our way in class, we will fall asleep easily.

So it's really not your fault that you fall asleep in class.

But even so, we still want to gain something after paying for the class. Is there any way to make this class more effortless?

have. The way to do it is to go to class "with a question". This is why we emphasized creating a "pre" map of our own learning in the very first chapter.

The so-called "preview" for class does not mean reading the textbook first. Instead, prepare a list of questions you really want to know about this field.

If the teacher starts boring you ten minutes before class, then you can start taking this list of questions and switch to active learning mode.

It means that you can start to let go (don't care about what the teacher wants to study), focus on what you want to learn, and dig for treasures in the rest of the time.

We are deeply harmed by passive learning in education. We often think that we need to be polite. No matter what the quality of the teacher's class is, if we endure listening to the whole class, no matter what, we will always gain something. This is actually wrong.

In fact, when you start to feel unhappy in the first ten minutes or twenty minutes, you will never be able to maintain a keen attention to capture what you are going to learn, so that at the end of the class, you will even have "I have a day today. What the hell are you doing?" the anger.

Instead, it is better to give up following the teacher's rhythm and focus on solving "what problem do you want to solve when you come to class today". Just focus on memorizing the answers to these questions.

## Tip 2: Improve return on cost

It's not just courses that should do this. Even attending seminars, you should do the same.

We humans are very strange. We often have a strange expectation of listening to lectures in class. Just expect the lessons to be perfect, fun, informative, and immediately useful.

Although this is our expectation. But you will find that the real world may not be like this. In fact, if you look back on your past class experience, you will probably find that 80% of the classes you have taken before are not like this: the teacher's teaching skills are bad, the class is boring, and I can't understand it. , Can't learn something after class.

There are many, many factors behind this. From the teacher's class skills, the wrong course objectives, the mismatch between the course content and the students' level, and more than a dozen of them are possible.

The point is, the odds of a person getting what you think are the perfect class is too low. It's really hard to come up with a class tailored just for you.

So instead of chasing this unrealistic goal all the time, it’s better to focus on “what problem do you want to solve?”

I just became a programmer and was excited to go to a tech seminar for the first time. But after attending a few times, the seminars cooled down a bit. Because going to technical seminars, of course, you can learn the technology that has been researched in advance. But the process was painful.

The reason is that some of these predecessors have very powerful programming skills. But the slideshow arrangement and presentation skills are really terrible. Sometimes the above skills are really powerful, but we hear them very painfully. As long as I can learn any skills, I quickly copy the clips home, and I can stop the speaker after class and then ask for advice.

It's still a one-day seminar. Sometimes seminars are three days with dozens of talks, or even multi-track a day. A multi-track seminar with a high concentration but poor presentation technique is acceptable. When it comes to water speech, it will be super dry. However, sometimes I still hold wishful thinking, find a way to listen to it, and try to get a little useful from it.

After all, I spent so much on my travel expenses, and I flew thousands of miles to listen to it.

Later I found out that it really doesn't work. Because sometimes there are thousands of miles away, and only 3 of 10 speeches can be heard.

When I go back, I will review why this started to happen. It turns out that this is the way the world actually works. (It's possible that your technical level has risen and you can't listen to simple ones. It's possible that those very powerful speakers have exercised to a certain extent and retired. It's possible that the standard of seminars and talks has dropped, etc.)

If I still use the thinking that I must get 10 out of 10, I will look at seminars and listen to lectures, then I will definitely be myself.

If the reality is that you have heard such a low win rate of 3 out of 10. How can I improve the return on travel expenses?

So later I attended technical seminars and had my own way of listening.

1. I only listen to the problems I want to solve, and write down the key points when I hear them. Anyway, these programmers are all open source demons, and the slideshow must be online. So if you don't understand, just download the slideshow and slowly read what he wrote on it. If you feel that the content is rubbish or completely incomprehensible, just go to the lobby and find someone to chat with.
2. If there is no question you need to know on the slide. After the end, find the speaker and talk to him, just ask him directly. Programmers are eager for others to understand his miracles, and most of the questions will be answered with just a few words of praise. Even he will eagerly ask you to leave an email and send you the answer or answer in a few days.

Also because of this era, most technical seminars are videotaped and publicly available online.

So when I attend technical seminars, I am used to only focus on the Talks where I may find the answer, and the chapters where I may find the answer, and concentrate on taking notes and summarizing. After listening, go straight to the speaker to clarify your doubts.

Even sometimes, when I go to a seminar, I only attend the "workshop" attached to the seminar, because the speech is videotaped, but the workshop is not videotaped. These workshops may be scattered all over the United States at times. In order to advertise or help the community, they will be held during the conference, so I will take this opportunity to supplement these procedural knowledge.

### Bored Talk can skip class or sleep directly

Then you might be wondering what to do with a speech that is really unfocused and painful. My answer is to go straight to sleep or skip class. Most people will think that this is a waste of money, haven't they already paid high travel expenses? Wouldn't it be a shame not to hear all the speeches?

My point is that taking classes across time zones is already exhausting. Concentration is greatly compromised, and I'd like to leave precious focus to those that are worth my energy. There's no need to make yourself miserable.

### Make friends while attending seminars or classes

Or, you can make friends in these boring TALKs. Sometimes we come across speeches with great headlines but poor content. Poor content may be because the speaker is too shallow, or the key point is wrong, or there is a problem with the content structure.

But don't worry, you can still waste this class. Because most of the students who will come to the class must be people who are just as interested in this topic as you are. There may even be speakers who are far more powerful than the speakers on stage.

You should take the time to get to know the people inside, whether it's a discussion or a private rant about the speaker. On the contrary, you can also gain more content than the class.

## **Method 2: Record Talk Study Verbatim and Summarize Highlights**

This method is something that technology has begun to keep up with in recent years. In this era, there are voice recorders and paid artificial voice sorting and recognition.

There are several reasons why we are easily tired from listening to stories:

1. What comes out of narration is sound, the brain receives the sound and converts it into understandable concepts, which consumes a lot of energy
2. Understand and transcribe and integrate it into one's own experience and memory, which consumes more energy
3. The voice is linear, so when the teacher shares his own experience, you can't actually grasp what he wants to say, and you don't know whether it is related to your own purpose. So if the teacher's opening 15 minutes is not exciting, the audience's attention and CPU may be diverted to other attention due to idling.

Also because of the way of telling, whether the teacher has a good opening, and whether the content of the story is well known to the audience, it is very lucky.

So in such a situation, I would probably record the entire talk and pay for it to be converted into a transcript when I go home.

And use the "speed reading method" (see the book Building a Superhuman Brain, this method will not be re-described in this book) to pick out the key points I want to know and redo the notes.

I know that my memory and efficiency in studying text content is far better than using voice.

And study on the text, rather than listening to the sound. Text can do "forward", "backward", and "search" that voice content cannot quickly do.

So I am very accustomed to "literalizing" these courses when I take on-site courses and online courses.

Then use the speed reading method, study it again, and summarize the key points.

## **Important key: organize notes during intermission and relay before the end of the day**

Also because I've read Ebbinghaus's theory

> After 1 hour, 56% were forgotten and 44% were remembered.

I know very well that memory is like fruit, if you don't pick it up and preserve it, it will decay and disappear.

So, when I attend seminars, I organize my notes every hour. Re-order the key points noted in the field.

And at noon or in the evening, at least one live broadcast will be held, and I will directly describe my experience that day.

The benefits of live streaming are:

1. I know that there is a real person on the other side of the camera. I will use the tone of the teacher to teach ordinary people, and try to reconnect what I learned in the speech and explain it in a way that I understand and the other person can understand. This is equivalent to the first profound "review".
2. The speed of rewriting and rewriting notes is slow and time-consuming. If the way I organize in midfield is to take notes and not to broadcast. I'm afraid it will consume too much brain power. After listening to the other sessions, I lost my attention. So this action, I usually do it after returning to the hotel or the next day after the event.
3. Live broadcasts usually have video recordings. So it is equivalent to a voice quick note on the spot. If I organize the notes later, I can directly convert the video into text, and organize the notes faster. And this time the notes are organized, even if it is the second profound "review".

Then, after I go back to the hotel, if I haven't slept yet. I will try my best to organize the whole day's notes directly on the day, whether it is written in text, or start another live broadcast to organize.

So, when I attend a workshop, I will perform memory summarization and sorting at least twice that day.

That way, when I'm blogging or taking long notes during the week, I can basically remember a lot of details. And some courses, after I organized them like this, basically many key concepts, I will never forget them again.

## Re-creation: Make your own new framework, even use it several times

Although this method is effective, most of what remains is "factual" and "conceptual" knowledge.

After a long time, I will still forget most of the content in it. What I can remember is probably just remembering which keywords to use, and re-find it on my external storage space (blog, FB experience, private note software) .

So be part of my skill set.

I usually explore this knowledge and make it into a set of small framework routines.

Apply directly. Even use it several times.

The most perverted deed I ever did was when I struggled to find the first edition of Extremely Quick Calligraphy (I had just increased the speed of writing books from one book every six months to one book a month). So I made a perverted move. Within a short period of time after I finished writing this book, I used this framework again and wrote a new book within a week.

To verify the feasibility of my own "theory", and to be proficient in the process and underlying principles of the framework I invented.

At first listening, you might think that my obsession is a bit perverted.

But in fact, when I am programming, I learn things and invent frameworks, and most of them have similar habits.

After I took Bob Pike's course, and after I studied Bloom's teaching taxonomy, and many books on cognitive psychology, I will also apply the theory extracted from it to my original workflow. Create new frameworks or blend old ones to make sure I actually "get" this skill.
