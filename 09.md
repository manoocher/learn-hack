# Chapter 9 Fuel the ignition and turn your learning journey into a game

You must be thinking, finished with the principles of game design. Next we should talk about the octagonal dynamic frame mentioned in Chapter 8. How to choose short-term and long-term motivations that suit you as learning reinforcers. Let's go further and reach our destination.

It's a pity I didn't intend to discuss this topic first.

Because the vast majority of people who come from school, the vast majority of **motivation** are very strong.

The motivation is not the point, but **sustainability**.

While I was writing this book, I collected many of the biggest complaints about learning in the market. such as:

1. Unable to last, you may study for a day or two, and get bored on the third day
2. Too many daily tasks to concentrate on (can’t have enough time to study)
3. It takes too long to explore when it is too difficult to learn
4. Inability to persist in learning difficulties
5. No coaching, no grading system
6. The motivation is strong at the beginning, but the persistence is not enough
7. Sometimes the rhythm of the course is very procrastinated. Before the class, I don’t know what to talk about today, and I don’t know where my progress is during the class. After listening to it, I found that I spent a lot of time and didn’t get anything at all.
8. When encountering something that is incomprehensible at a glance, often shrink back.
9. Some online courses do not fast forward or verbatim and the pace is very slow, you will want to close it
10. I can't see my significant growth, I'm very discouraged, and I don't have self-confidence.
11. The things you learn are messy, there is no system, you can’t integrate yourself, and you don’t know how much, you can’t get addicted like playing electric games, or you can see the experience value and level.
12. Learning is incoherent and easily interrupted and distracted by other things. There are some concepts that you don't understand, so that you won't be able to understand them later when you talk about more in-depth topics. The older you are, the more you will learn about your mood. When you are in a good mood, you will pay full attention. But when I'm in a bad mood, I want to shift focus.

These complaints may seem different, but are essentially the same.

### Who am I, where am I, what am I going to do next?

These complaints are essentially about the following things:

1. I don’t know what my long-term goals are
2. I don’t know what my short-term goals are
3. I don't know what I'll get in an hour
4. I don't know what I'll get in the next ten minutes
5. I don't know if I can complete an assignment in the next 5-10 minutes, copying the teacher's set of movements.
6. I don't know if I'm on the right track
7. Where is my current progress
8. How long will it take to finish

These points can be simply condensed into:

1. Where is my progress now?
2. Am I going in the right direction?
3. How long will it take to complete my immediate goals, short-term goals, and long-term goals.

We can condense it into one sentence, in the "coordinate axis" of this game.

Imagine if a friend introduced a new game and told you it was fun. As a result, you purchased the download from Steam and opened it, and the game threw you in a foggy forest at the beginning, and didn't know how to continue. What will you do next.

The answer is, just quit and delete it and ask for a refund.

A foggy forest is what most people feel like in a badly designed course. I don't know why I'm here, where the hell am I, what am I going to do next.

Most people will feel that learning oneself is half-way, three minutes of heat, very guilty. Looking for a stronger lasting agent. But in fact, this is unlikely.

Because the longest attention span of humans is this "three minutes". Of course, this "three minutes" does not really refer to 3 minutes (270) seconds, but human attention, short-term memory, and the tolerance of learning sinking time has a maximum limit. For example:

- The video is 1 minute 30 seconds long. If a video does not have any key points or breaking points, it must be turned off within 90 seconds. (This is also the restriction in the early days of Douyin)
- The round limit for a game is 3-5 minutes. For example, the addictive civilization empire is a round of 3 minutes, and as a result, players often play and play accidentally and it will dawn. The mobile game King of Glory, which is popular all over China, is also 3-5 minutes per round. It's easy to keep challenging people without realizing it.
- A small chapter of an offline course, which should be 15 minutes. Because of human short-term memory, the longest is only 15 minutes.
- A large chapter of the course under one class, which should be 45 minutes. Because humans get tired. It is best to take 1 hour and rest for 10-15 minutes, otherwise students will easily collapse.
- The study of a small routine, preferably 1 hour, in the morning, can be completed in one day. Because adult learning has time cost issues.
- A time-consuming homework assignment, preferably within 30 minutes. Because adults don't have as much focus at home.

Humans are creatures who seek certainty. What you expect to enter, you will get what results. At the same time, there is also a mental account hard limit for the degree of resource consumption.

Unfortunately, whether it is a student or a teacher, what they often pursue is "the longer the better." It seems that the longer the C/P value, the higher the C/P value. Finish the class at a time.

It's like a novice running a marathon (don't think most learning behaviors are similar?). Unfortunately, it will fail in the end.

Because in learning, what human beings are essentially pursuing is:

1. The sooner you learn the better
2. Repeat, OK, Done
3. See yourself making significant progress
4. See yourself reaching your nearest goal

### Points / Badge / Leaderboard

When we talk about gamification of education, teachers who teach the class of "gamification" will always warn the participating learners not to abuse the PBL system. That is, the three mechanisms of Points / Badge / LeaderBoard. Gamify education, don't think that simply adding PBL will make students addicted or interesting.

In fact, this sentence is right and wrong. The real gamification process is very complicated. It has to be designed along the way from how to design the basic gameplay of the game, divide the levels, and appropriately introduce short-term motivation and long-term motivation at different stages.

But at the root of why PBLs are useful and often abused. This is because PBL "visualizes" the learning effect.

- I got 1000 chips for answering the question correctly. (Points)
- I got the title of "Badge" for answering the most frequently asked questions
- Our entire group was ranked second in the class. (LeaderBoard)
- I passed the exam and got LV2 certification

PBL can effectively let us know who we are (to what extent), where we are now (relative degree), and what to do later (get more points, kill the opponents in the next group, dominate the leaderboard)

It is very effective in attracting short-term attention and gives a very definite effect. (Although this has certain side effects, if you keep winning, of course it's cool. If you keep losing, you're more likely to give up.)

But the point is, teachers who understand gamified design are rare, and you may not come across them. Therefore, as students, the most likely thing to do is to design our own PBL.

- Let yourself know where your progress is
- Under normal circumstances, how to set your own reasonable learning goals
- In general, how long would such a learning journey take for other completers?
- How do I visualize my learning outcomes and give myself a sense of progress every day
- How to cut the learning process into affordable consumption for my daily mental/physiological account/reality. (For example, Dongsen will not allow players to play unlimitedly, nor does it want players to play unlimitedly within a day. Usually, today's task can be completed in 30-120 minutes in one day)

Let yourself know: who am I, where am I, what am I going to do next?

### Fuel thrust and planetary gravity

But how to apply the gamification octagon theory to your own dynamic design?

When the Octagonal Dynamics framework is used to analyze games, you can see what motivations a game uses to drive player behavior. But when I designed the game myself, I didn't know how to start.

This was also the biggest obstacle when I was learning gamification applications. Later, after constantly dismantling the motives of human beings, I finally figured out how to use it. In fact, the application of the octagon theory is not to be used randomly depending on the mood.

The whole system should be the relationship between the rocket (player) and the planet (target).

![](images/20211023164033.png)

The short-term goal is fuel thrust. The long-term motivation is planetary gravity.

And of course the most important "navigation system" (who am I, where am I, what am I going to do next?).

If the planet is close (short-term goal), a puff of fuel will pass. There is no need for planetary gravity and navigation systems at all. For example, sometimes we want to let certain people do things, just give them money.

But most of the time, money doesn't work. Because the destination is too far away, most of the time when we want to reach the destination, we drift past in space. At this time, we need to rely on the gravitational force between the stars and the correct navigation system to get there.

If we want to take a journey that is not too short, the most important thing is to design travel nodes, correct navigation directions, and use gravity to slowly pull. The fuel is only used for short injections to correct the angle.

In the second chapter, we mentioned the 64-frame plan of Shohei Otani. Does it seem a little interesting now?

![](images/20211023164137.png)

## How to design your own game

We talked about the importance of the navigation system in the last paragraph. But the question is how to design the navigation system?

And the most common problem we have in learning is to walk the wrong way, and then accidentally use too much energy. just gave up.

What's more, most self-study students have not gone through this road. How to set the correct goals, directions, navigation system. Allow yourself to have goals and a sense of achievement.

Designing a Hero's Journey looks great in theory. But how do I start?

## How is the game designed? (pencil design)

Let's put it another way, how is your own learning game designed?

In theory, we have small routines, big routines, short-term motivation, long-term motivation, and PBL. It should be assembled and you're done. But it's actually not that simple.

Because as long as it is easy to learn, has strong motivation, and has interesting design, you can design a fun game. Then there will be no more bad games in this world. Easy to pick up is just the basics, but being able to play consistently for a month is hard.

Many game designers also feel that game design is also quite psychic.

So, is there a way for game design?

This question is actually very difficult to answer. I've read over a hundred game design books and even asked quite a few game designers. Finally, I dug up a key method in a book called Gamestorming (most people's answers are like psychics, some say they should be attentive, some say they should have core gameplay, some say they should add interesting mechanisms, and some say they should be exciting game script).

Gamestorming is a book that points out the biggest blind spot of us average people when it comes to accomplishing something, or trying to guide others down a path.

![](images/20211024145251.png)

It is often that we feel that we have to go from A (starting point) to B (end point).

1. Both A and B are a clear point
2. And it can be connected directly

This is our expectation of the unknown. But in fact, in the end, you will find that the point b you thought floated around (the information was lost when you found it). And the road in the middle is not a straight line (there will be many forks and walks crookedly).

So in fact, the normal exploration process should be like this

![](images/20211024145339.png)

Point B is not a point, but a blurred line, with a squiggly line between A and B.

So, a game should look like this. Like a double pointed pencil.

![](images/20211024145504.png)

A is a starting point and B is an ending point. A starts from a divergent process, but gradually converges to an end point when it reaches B. And in this process, there are clear boundaries. And the player is in it through exploration, and gradually floats to the other side. and can be in different poses

![](images/20211024145540.png)

And in the process, it can even be cut into three pencils.

It even continued to be broken down into countless pencils.

## Bridge method

Wait, see this, do you look familiar? How similar structures have appeared in the creation of superhuman brains. (persistent writing)

In this chapter I describe how to quickly write a book. This chapter is a relatively unfortunate chapter, because most people do not need to write books. But this method can also be used for learning.

In the book Building a Superhuman Brain, the topic I used to demonstrate is: The Growth Path of an Engineer.

### STEP1 : Define the start and end points and the difficulty

![](images/20211024135558.png)

1. Define the start and end points
2. Sort out why the average person fails halfway through

### STEP1 : Turn difficult points into stepping stones

On the way to B, it must be difficult. We are going to cross a river, and there must be dark pits and whirlpools everywhere. It sank as soon as it slipped.

Then can we think about it the other way around, fill the hole directly, and put a big stepping stone on it, is it better to cross the river?

![](images/20211023164503.png)

When we finish writing, we can even find that this pile of stepping stones can be divided into three categories. And also in order.

So, isn't it like the three pencil structure diagrams mentioned earlier.

![](images/2021-10-24-31203.png)

Then we break down

Like the first stage, when programmers are looking for a job, the first job is the most important. The main focus should be on the first job, how to absorb a lot of experience, to decide which direction you want to go in the future, and to find resources.

![](images/20211023164609.png)

In the second stage, you should exercise your collaboration ability and your own refinement skills.

![](images/20211023164618.png)

In the third stage, programmers will enter the youth that will no longer fight with others for physical strength. Rather, it is the stage of combining skills. This stage requires management skills and business sense.

![](images/20211023164628.png)

You will find that these four pieces of paper can be a chapter of the career map taught by the old programmer to the applet, or it can be a map to search for information in the future if you want to change careers to become a programmer.

Each of these subtitles can be a process (subroutine). Every big title is a stage (big routine).

At this point, our level design in Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 is completed. In fact, the difference between teacher teaching and self-study is whether there is a ready-made answer for you.

If you can't find the answer. You can also follow the instructions in Chapter 7

1. What is **XX? **
2. **Why is it important? **
3. **How ​​to do it? **
4. **How ​​to do it 10 times faster? **

The cycle does it.

## Menu learning method

Readers should notice that in this book I cite a lot of cooking examples as examples. There are several reasons:

1. Cooking is a common scene in life, almost everyone can understand my metaphor
2. You don't need to learn big principles to make a dish, you can do it by imitating/input/output. Let's talk about whether it tastes good or not.
3. When you are hungry, you don’t care about so many big things. Just pour the dishes in and start cooking, and you can eat them when they are cooked.
4. You can have a full meal and you will feel a sense of accomplishment if you eat it accidentally

I often hear a lot of people complain that they can't make time to study in their own life.

In fact, I think it is because everyone has too much time and too much face in Versailles to learn impossible dishes.

![](images/20211023164647.png)

For example, beginners are challenged to learn the pagoda meat of Master Wang Gang.

Master Wang Gang's pagoda meat is very powerful. But making pagoda meat is not only about the kitchen utensils (a large kitchen pot and a special pagoda are required), but also the seasonings are difficult to prepare, and more importantly, there is a knife that requires several years of practice behind this dish! ! ! !

When I practice my skills, I usually use a very simple home-cooked practice method.

1. First understand what you like to eat. What to eat. What can I do with my current weak ability.
2. Then first, find a few recipes that you can eat often without getting tired, and you can get full immediately after eating.
3. Learn to cook first, just don't care about the order, imitate the teacher's demonstration and pour it in, and finally cook it and eat it.
4. After I finished it myself, I started to know that the onion and garlic should be fragrant first, how to not put too much salt, and how not to burn.

In this, you can gradually understand

1. What is the order of the dishes?
2. What is the most important seasoning in it?
3. Is there any quick way to get it out of the oven?
4. How can I cook four dishes at the same time in 20 minutes?
5. Which seasonings are prepared in the refrigerator at home
6. What kind of sauces can be beaten in one jar. Every dish is delicious.

With that in mind, break down the problem you want to solve into the smallest possible menu. Prepare and cook according to the idea and mentality of cooking. Various goals are easy to accomplish and it is easy to have a sense of accomplishment.
