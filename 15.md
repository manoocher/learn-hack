# Class (1) How to save effort and learn from the teacher

Learning is usually divided into two directions, one is self-study (reading books), and the other is class teacher learning.

Learning from a teacher is usually a faster way to learn. This is because humans have their own mirror neuron functions for motion replication, which can usually be simulated after seeing them once. Sometimes, the effect of reading several books is not as good as seeing the master's demonstration with your own eyes.

Although it is with the purchase of courses, the learning speed is faster with the teacher. But this is actually not a path that everyone will choose to go out of society. There are several reasons for this:

- The course fee is too expensive
- I don't understand waste of money
- Some very simple things are talked about for a long time, but the really important things are taken carelessly
- Sometimes classes are a waste of time (after leaving the society, I have very little rest time and less time to do homework)
- Some teachers teach very well, some teach so badly that they fall asleep halfway through
- Even if the teacher teaches badly, he still can't leave. Nightmares from school are repeated.

We can organize these complaints as

- Waste of time, waste of money
- Can't understand, can't learn, can't remember
- The teacher sucks, the teacher is too advanced but I don't understand

In fact, there are several possibilities behind this

- The teacher doesn't know how to teach, which makes it easier for you to learn
- Teachers only have professional knowledge and do not understand "teaching"
- The course does not match your level
- The teacher's lectures in class consume your attention, and you forget what's in front of you after listening to it
- Tired from class and want to sleep. Tired after class, no time to practice.

How do we dodge these thunders?

## Step 1: Identify whether you are learning from a teacher, a senior or an advanced novice

In this area of ​​"learning from the teacher". The biggest pitfall is choosing teachers. Because in the process of "learning from the teacher", we usually adopt the "passive learning method", that is, we learn what the teacher teaches.

So, if your teacher is a master, he can get you to heaven. The teacher you teach is a bad teacher, and the end is usually not just living in a suite, but letting you go from excited entry to instant abandonment on the spot.

However, a beginner is someone who is unfamiliar with the field. So how do we have a way to pick out relatively good teachers?

There is an idea in this. Not everyone who is better than you is a teacher. It is also possible that they are just seniors.

We can divide people who are better than you into several levels:

- LV 1 is just someone with more experience than you
- LV 2 People who have their own unique way of doing things
- LV 3 A person who can teach people how to do things 1 to 1
- LV 4 people who can teach one-to-many methods
- Lv 5 can be one-to-many, and can also learn a high rate of people
- LV 6 Those who are proficient in field technology and also proficient in teaching methods

![](images/20211024113255.png)

Usually LV 4-6 can be called teachers. LV1-3 can only be called seniors.

When we also classify the "teacher", there may be fewer opportunities to learn to step on the pit. Why do I say this?

Earlier we talked about a chapter on the Dreyfus model.

We usually think of someone with more experience than you as a teacher. In fact, a field is filled with a lot of advanced newbies. These people are just learning the basics and basics. Because they only know very little fur, they usually only have the means to deal with the basics.

- Don't know there are shortcuts, don't believe there are shortcuts
- I don't know there are routines, and I don't believe there are routines

If you learn kung fu from "advanced novice". This is miserable. They will always tell you that learning is very hard, there are no shortcuts, and you must learn from the "basics", otherwise it will be easy to overturn.

You will be a little surprised to hear this, don't "everyone" in every field say to start from the basics?

This is because the word "everyone" is a mathematical problem. When more than 50% of the entire field is advanced novices, follow the law of large numbers. We naturally think that "loud" and "many times" are right.

If you think about proficient + expert, the ratio is only 11%. They don't even bother to refute those mentally retarded remarks online.

I have heard countless newbies complain that they want to learn to write programs, and people on the Internet tell him to go back to learn C language, starting from "basic knowledge". As a result, he went from entry to giving up. And these newbies even go to programming routine classes. They were also severely excluded by these "senior newbies".

Advanced beginners will say that programmers cannot be taught in cram schools. Real men are self-taught online, wild and hard training. This despised group not only despised teachers who went to programming classes, but even despised teachers in programming classes (thinking that they were only programmers who couldn’t get along before they came out to cheat newbies to make money).

Is there really no way to systematically cultivate programming technology? How is this possible.

You can think about it, the industry needs so many programmers, is it too late for programmers to teach themselves? What's more, an engineer of an Internet company, in addition to being able to write programs, must learn the business requirements before writing the program.

Of course, there are architects and colleagues above the expert level in the company to train new people, and the speed of training is often expected to be ready for combat within 1-3 months. After all, the company does not recruit people to open schools, but to recruit people to work. If there are no shortcuts in the industry, no quick martial arts secrets. How does the industry develop and grow?

There will even be famous companies or famous teams that everyone wants in the industry. Because of these teams, the growth rate of newbies will be super high after joining.

And why do these advanced novices feel that it is important to learn from the basics?

This is where they happened to be at an embarrassing point. They were just pulled up by their predecessors with a framework. They were familiar with the basic process, but lacked basic common sense. Therefore, it is still difficult to solve the answer smoothly and freely. That's why they feel that basic knowledge is very important.

He even felt that the reason why they kept encountering pitfalls was that his master didn't teach him the "correct order", which caused him to keep hitting the wall. That's why they repeatedly brainwash the newbies and say that there is no shortcut to practice the basics.

If you are learning techniques from "advanced novice", the pits are dead.

Not only do they have no routines, but they also make you have to learn from the "basics", and you will be exhausted (bored to death).

You now know why some classes are sometimes life-threatening, right?

So you have to be very clear about the difference between a senior novice, a senior, and a teacher.

## Step 2: **Learn the routine with the "correct" teacher**

So "correct" and "good" teachers. What are the characteristics?

In fact, sometimes these good teachers are really hard to come by. You can also sometimes have a hard time telling who is good and who is bad. Sometimes even the powerful ones are regarded as bad (sometimes the average person even regards the expensive and straightforward teachers as bad)

A good teacher must come up to teach routines first. There are so many teachers in Jianghu, it may be difficult to tell who is good and who is bad. But what I have to say is that a teacher with rich practical experience, regardless of whether his teaching skills are good or not, will definitely bring his own routines.

And their teaching definitely starts from the routines. And this "routine" is the so-called "procedural knowledge".

Don't look at the word "routine", just underestimate this set of "procedural knowledge". This set of knowledge is likely to be the treasure that this teacher will condense and condense the important knowledge points and pit points in dozens of the most common scenarios in this industry into a set of procedures to teach you after reaching the pinnacle of the industry.

Sometimes, some teachers even edit the textbooks because they are too good. Beginners think "too easy", "too simple" and "too basic", so they don't want to learn.

Actually, if you think it is easy, simple and intuitive. This is often because the other party is very good at teaching and knows how to simplify complex things. Even make good use of metaphors (cross boundaries to establish correlations in the brain) so that you can easily understand.

The "foundation" in the line is that these scenarios occur most often, and the scenarios often have fixed output results and can be predicted. Learning these scenarios and skilled output results can solve 80% of the problems.

Humans are essentially biological robots that rely on deterministic mechanisms to survive. Uncommon if results are not fixed. would be considered difficult. Scenarios that are too common, too predictable, and logically simple are considered simple.

## Step 3: **Follow the routine three times**

But common, does not mean that there is no need to spend time on it, because "learning" itself is a process that is internalized to allow the body to correctly execute and reproduce the results.

Since this routine is after the teacher has reached the pinnacle of the industry, he will condense the important knowledge points in dozens of the most common scenarios in this industry into a set of procedures to teach you.

So it is very important to be proficient in this routine.

It's like if you learn to play football, you can't even dribble and control the ball freely, let alone shoot with the ball?

But the vast majority of bad courses designed by advanced novices are like this. Let newbies spend 20 minutes understanding/turning their backs on their meaningless knowledge.

![](images/20211024113316.png)

When it comes to the practice stage, they are no longer interested in practicing.

And even most people regard "remembering knowledge" as "learning skills". It doesn't even matter if you don't practice.

So, how do you learn this way?

As we explained in the previous chapter, the so-called "remembering knowledge" and "learning skills" are even governed by different areas, and even the retention time of protection is different.

And even you have to use the memory organ with high preservation (muscle nerve bundle) to learn, not the memory organ with high amnesia (brain) to memorize.

If you have practiced it three times at home, then even if you take a class like this, the effect is almost as good as that of some advanced novices who are headless flies for more than a year.

## Tip 1: Practice right after class

In addition to these sequences, there are actually some additional tips for learning routines from teachers. Among them, I think the most important thing is: practice right after class.

This is because the retention of skills is time-limited.

Even if a teacher teaches you a great framework, if you don't practice it physically within the time limit, don't apply it. After a long time (about 1-2 weeks), it will be forgotten.

> The so-called sensory memory of the body, the principle is that when the body performs an action, it will bring impulses to the nerve fibers. The so-called memory circuit of myelin is the transmission of electrical impulses through nerve fibers. Myelin is a layer of insulating material that wraps around the outside of the nerve pathway. When a part of the nerve pathway is used in practice, this part of the myelin sheath grows. The more you practice, the thicker the insulation and the faster the information in the pathway.

My own habit is that after finishing the skill class, I will practice it once, or even three times for short skills, depending on the situation.

Make sure I remember the flow and "feel" like this.

##Secret 2: Learn with your body, not your head

Then again, the most important thing about procedural knowledge is to use the body to replicate actions and remember sensations.

In fact, I use this process no matter what skills I learn. The benefits of learning this way:

1. Copying skills is fast
2. After mastering the whole process and practicing fluent basic movements, it is not easy to be distracted by some trivial branch problems, and the body can automatically respond
3. When the body can automatically respond, the brain does not need as much energy, and it does not always feel like I am doing things all the time. With only 20 points, is it because he has no talent. If you use your body to learn, it is easy to feel that you are an 80-point genius who can get started as soon as you learn.

When I was learning to drive, I also used this method to learn to drive. Within 1 hour, I learned to "reverse the car into the garage", "S-turn" and "street parking". The teacher has always praised me as a driving genius, and my progress is super fast

Because I was learning to drive for the first time. Didn't care too much.

When my colleague came back and asked me about the progress of today's driving training class, I said that I learned three things in a day: "reversing the car into the garage", "S-turn" and "street parking". What will be taught later?

He was very surprised. Because of the progress of these three things, it is almost necessary to learn at least a week for the average person. How to open how to press the line. I learned it all in under an hour.

I just realized that I may have used the right method again by accident.

Because, driving itself is a skill, if you use your "brain" to drive, it will definitely be knotted. I guess that's why so many people take so long to learn these three ways of transporting cars.

## Tip 3: Go home and do it exactly the same way at least twice, and then modify it according to your own preferences for the third time

When a novice is just starting to learn, there is still a misunderstanding in learning. Just too impatient. Because when people learn a skill, they often have to use it right away.

Therefore, their learning method is to practice at least 1-2 times according to the framework, and they will learn and use them at the same time. This seems to be faster. But in fact it will probably explode.

Because the masters of these routines, they have gone through countless pits, and finally designed a set of completely pit-free routines.

Novices may have no idea how treacherous and mine-filled the field of learning is. Therefore, as long as you change yourself, you often throw yourself into a mine pit that you don't know.

On the contrary, the teacher appeared perfectly in class, and I imitated it perfectly in class, but when I went home and did it myself, it exploded.

It's really because you haven't internalized the reason. If you really want to apply it to business, it is best to draw the gourd a few times first, and then start to modify it into your own version.

After I learn the framework, I usually go around the road and familiarize myself with the road before I start the magic reform.

But it also takes a little patience. But it's quite effective

### **Knowledge that you don't like, you can also learn it like this**

This experience of practicing three times, I can give an example of a super difficult subject (studying "modern algebra" in the mathematics department of a university.

When I was in college, although I was in the Department of Applied Mathematics. But I'm not really that crazy about math. Therefore, for many disciplines, it is casually handled. After all, I actually wanted to study programming in this department.

However, since my dad wanted me to do a master's after college. So I had to go to tutoring. When I took the master's degree, there was a subject that was linear algebra. When I was a sophomore in this course, I only got more than 20 points in the midterm and final exams, so I was taken.

So, I had to go to tutoring in my junior year. The teacher who taught me at that time was Mr. Huang Zijia (now deceased) who was known as the "God of Line Generation". After I followed Mr. Huang for a month or two, my linear algebra skills improved by leaps and bounds. I took linear algebra in my junior year and scored more than 80 points in the midterm exam. My line-generation teacher had absolutely no idea what kind of drug I was taking.

But after following Mr. Huang Zijia to do mathematics in his way, I seem to have become enlightened and interested in the mathematics of linear algebra and algebra. Algebra and linear algebra have similar names. But they are actually two completely different disciplines.

Renewed interest in algebra, which was supposed to lead me to retake this course. In the mid-term exam, not only was the first hand in the paper, but also a broken score of 120 points (out of 100, plus 20 questions). What's more, there were more than 60 people in the class. More than 40 people scored 100 points. You must know that the mid-term exam scores of the mathematics department are actually mostly around 40 points on average for the whole class. Let the teacher suspect that our whole class is cheating.

Do you know what happened to be like this?

At that time, because of the high score in the linear algebra exam, I ignited my hope in mathematics. So I reread algebra and solved all the exercises in the algebra textbook using the problem-solving thinking I learned in linear algebra. Not only that, but I also wrote all the solutions to the exercises, plus simple basic algebra concepts, into a booklet. To a friendly classmate. Tell them to copy this booklet at least 1-2 times.

In the mid-term exam, the teacher used all the exercises in the textbook, and then made some revisions to make the exam paper.

Those students who have "copied" this booklet several times. No surprises got full marks!

So since then, I've really liked this exercise and I've enjoyed writing booklets! That's why my book series has such a strong "booklet" flavor.

## Step 4: Take notes and post them publicly

Being able to practice a kung fu solidly is not just by practicing it three times. Also take notes.

But when it comes to taking notes. To be honest, I really didn't grow up in school. It is learned from outside the society.

When I was studying at school, I was a person who didn't like to take notes.

Why don't you like taking notes?

There are several reasons:

1. I can't understand what the teacher said in class, so I don't know whether to choose to understand or write notes. While I'm still hesitating, class has already ended Orz
2. I see that the notes written by other people are very beautiful, and I also want to imitate other people's note-taking methods. But when I'm busy copying notes using their note-taking method, I don't remember anything after class
3. If I copy the notes in my own way, it will be very scribbled. I don't know how to organize, and I don't know what it means to organize. As a result, before the midterm exam, I stared at my notes in a daze. I had no choice but to borrow some of my classmates' exquisite notes to make up for it.

Therefore, in the early stage of K12, I could still use short-term memory to get high scores because of the simple teaching materials and reliable practice.

But at this stage of college, I was beaten by the huge amount of knowledge, not to mention, I was still studying in the mathematics department of the university.

College mathematics is completely different from high school mathematics.

If it is said that high school mathematics is reliable, it has been brushed.

Then college math itself can be described as a subject that teaches you to rethink everything in the universe.

Every student in the mathematics department does not have a very good graduation result, because after the sophomore year, we are learning "real" mathematics. The so-called real mathematics is to learn a new set of logical deduction methods, to understand mathematics, to disassemble mathematical problems from various angles, and even to prove mathematical theorems.

If you still use short-term memory in high school math, you will definitely be dismissed. Therefore, many people who can graduate from the Department of Mathematics are talents, and no one graduates without a few layers of skin.

In the process of creating superhuman thinking, the reason why I can use so many magical angles to dismantle problems.

That's because to put it bluntly, those seemingly magical methods are essentially mathematical problems-solving, dismantling, and proof methods.

### **Save found resources to external space**

I really leapt forward in technology because I met a senior at the age of 25. At that time, my senior was far ahead of me in technology, and I myself admired him at that time.

He himself likes to write notes very much, and there are often notebooks on the table and notebooks in his backpack. There is even a small notebook in the pocket. Remember everything.

I couldn't help but wonder one day. Ask him why his technology is so powerful and why he keeps memorizing it all day long. Also, what tricks does he have in memorizing things?

He said, no, he was just afraid that he would forget things, especially since his area of ​​expertise was in the field of machines, and there were a lot of trivial things to memorize. Therefore, he habitually wrote down the things he thought he would forget.

He also showed me his notebook, which was really nothing special, even just some of his temporary ghosts.

I thought to myself, the seniors are so technically advanced, and I felt that I would forget things, so I took notes.

I'm so useless, how can I not remember it? So I also bought a notebook and memorized everything.

After I started taking notes, although I only wrote down some ghost-drawn talismans and didn't organize them, I really remembered more.

Later, I felt that writing notes was too slow. So I don't write things down in the notes.

I'm writing on a project management system. A project management system is more like a task system.

A relatively large-scale Internet company will have a project management system inside. Because a set of website programs may require multiple programmers to write them together, they will use a similar task system internally to chop up the project and send it to each individual. Collaborative engineers are solved as tasks.

We engineers, when we write programs, are not like writers who write programs.

Many engineers below the senior engineer level are more like "assembly engineers" who "Google the answer and put it together".

It may sound like a waste to you to imagine. But this is the truth, and more people in the industry call themselves Stackoverflow engineers. Stackoverflow is a Q&A community for engineers. Usually when we go to Google to find an implementation, we end up with the final answer on Stackoverflow. So everyone copied the above code and went back to assemble and modify it.

If you're not an engineer, it might be shocking to hear this. However, we engineers feel that this is simply the daily life of the industry.

Also because on our computer, not only the editor but also the full Chrome Tab is opened. At that time, I thought that when I was looking for a problem, because the computer started to slow down, I often closed Tab and accidentally closed the answer I just found, and all I found were URLs or snippets of code.

So I developed a habit of posting the URL and the answers I found to the progress update of the task system.

It doesn't matter what I'm reading and remembering. In this way, even if I accidentally turn off the Tab, I can still come back here to get the research progress.

Later, I found that such a habit has greatly changed my efficiency and even produced a huge qualitative change.

Because I have the habit of writing brochures. So I am used to after learning to write a function, I want to write it as a tutorial and send it out.

In this way, the next time I write this function, I will finish writing the code after watching my tutorial. In this way, the efficiency of my code writing will be many times faster.

Also because when I work from Monday to Friday, I will post the resources I find under my task update. And each task is basically a function.

As a result, when I write tutorials on the weekends, it is almost effortless. Open those notes and links and my memory comes back.

So my tutorials are written fast and well. A friend of mine once joked that I was in the Ruby on Rails world back then. If you want to find functions and questions, just do a Google search and you can almost find Chinese answers on my blog XD

And I didn't mean to dominate the screen, because writing tutorials is actually a way for me to organize my knowledge on weekends.

### **Published**

Almost many senior engineers have the habit of raising tutorials and code bases. The only difference is that they are public and not public.

I also asked the seniors the question of whether it was public or not. He said his habit is to be public, he said, because if you post it publicly on your blog, you can find it back on Google. You are not public, do you build your own search engine?

I think so too. That's why in the end I have so many tutorials on the web.

To put it bluntly, it is for the convenience of myself to find information.

Also, writing notes publicly and publishing them is actually very beneficial.

1. Scientifically, complete the actions of reviewing, sorting, and reconstructing in a short period of time, and write them into long-term memory
2. People will praise your generosity
3. Because of these public notes, I will be connected to unimaginable opportunities. Meet many different friends and give you feedback.
4. These unexpected feedbacks not only bring opportunities for correction. Even, psychologically, it will be like a variable reward.

> Addict = Trigger -> Action -> Dynamic Reward。

So, learning programming has turned into an addictive and fun real-life electric motor, which is so fun that you can't stop.
