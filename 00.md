# Build superhuman learning: use your superpowers back

This is the third book in the "Building Superman" series.

After writing the previous book "Building a Superhuman Mind".

I was in trouble for a while, what topic should I write about next?

About overclocking the brain. The main issue:

- Hardware (learn to use your own brain)
- Software (learn to improve your own algorithms)

Everything seems to have been discussed, what more can be written?

But even so, I feel like I'm missing a very important subject.

But there is no clear direction for the time being.

Until some readers read these two books, they asked some methods related to learning.

I just discovered that this series is missing one and the most important theme: "Learning"

if we assume

- "Building a superhuman brain" is to learn how to operate your own brain
- "Building a superhuman mind" is a solution mode for learning how to change your own brain

Well, one more book is missing from the series:

> How to efficiently download surrounding information, patch your brain, and keep upgrading.

## Learning is the most important subject in our life

Creating Superman Learning This book is not only the most important series in the Superman series, but I think "learning" is the most important issue in life.

This is because the hardware that each of us is born with is actually almost the same, and it is almost difficult to change the hardware the day after tomorrow, and even if the hardware is adjusted, the performance improvement is limited.

The difference in the ability of each of us is essentially the efficiency of the algorithm running in our brains.

In addition to the initial conditions given by the natural family environment, the efficiency of the algorithm is also a bigger factor that is inseparable from "learning".

Humans have a built-in "learning" system, which, to put it bluntly, is itself the most important "downloader" of progress information.

We humans are adjusting ourselves to the surrounding environment through "learning" all the time.

“Learning” can be said to be a behavior that is triggered every hour, every minute of every day.

However, even this "behavior" triggers frequently. I think that, for a long time, the entire human artificial education system has lacked two directions for learning:

- How to learn more efficiently
- How to learn to be happier

The education system not only failed to solve these two problems, but even worsened the problem.

Our entire society suffers from "learning".

In fact, just talking about the word "learning", everyone doesn't even know whether to describe it as a "happy" or "painful" act.

Learning should turn out to be the one thing that makes us better. But the pain of the process is deterrent.

I've struggled with this in the past, and I've always wanted to change this.

I think "learning" is actually a joyful and productive thing.

In fact, it should also be something that makes people happy and productive.

## Use your superpowers

Before reading any further, I'm sure many readers will find this to sound dubious.

"How can learning be happy and efficient"?

In fact, this is what I think is the worst phenomenon right now.

Humans have many powerful potentials and abilities. But we ourselves are limited by ourselves.

- We should update ourselves with the downloader.
- Our downloader fails to update the downloader itself.
- And the downloader is getting slower and slower, so we thought we couldn't be updated
- In the end we thought we were a bad and getting worse machine

As the times progress, the more we panic about this issue. It seems that it can't keep up with the ever-changing technological upgrades and the changes of the times.

Is this all we can do for the rest of our lives?

In fact, there is no need to be so pessimistic. Because, all along, we can avoid walking down a flooded dead end. It's just that we never knew.

My point is: our downloader has never been broken. It's just that you never know how to use it efficiently, and even your downloader has been broken since childhood.

All I want to do is fix it.

This book will introduce a set of learning methods. This set of methods would be:

- scientifically sound
- Results are very certain
- Comfortable for the brain
- Compatible with old human habits
- very time saving
- The process is happy
- Applicable to all fields
- Immediately after use, the effect will be increased by 100 or 1000 times

Hope it can take you to fix the downloader. Unleash your original super powers. You can even no longer be crushed by the times, but become the person who can crush the times.

If the subtitle of creating superhuman thinking is how to increase IQ from 100 to 1000. And the ambition of this book for readers to read this book will even be: how to restore IQ from 100 to 10,000.

Let's start this journey of recovery!
