# Reading (2) Easily and effectively use the information in the book for your own use

Some readers may feel that I always say "throw the book", and they will be very reluctant.

But in fact, reading is like cooking. When you buy it, you have to wash it and cut it before you can eat it. And, if every book is the excrement of the author. Buy it back and deal with it first. Think about it, if you buy pig intestines and cook them in a pot without washing them, won't you eat your mouth full of shit?

This is actually why many readers fundamentally hate reading. Because I didn't go through three rounds of buying calligraphy, the books I bought directly were probably just gnawed raw, unable to chew with one bite, or eating a mouthful of dirt and rotten vegetables!

### Do I have to read every book?

However, readers may also have the next question, if we want to screen books, don’t we also read books? Isn't that back to square one?

！？

Not also. In fact, the first round of books does not need to be read at all. Furthermore, you don't have to "read" these books at all!

Just need to feel good. In fact, many readers (people who claim to have read a lot of books), most of the books they bought were just flipping through at the time. But he told everyone that he saw it.

In fact, it is very time-consuming to read a book intensively. If he roughly "skimming" every book he bought, it may even take a hundred years. So, the real truth may be that he only has to look it up at any time and claim that he has seen it.

But say "see" this thing. How strict should we define it? In fact, there is no legal provision.

The first round of buying books was originally used to filter the learning direction, so you can just look at it! Just feel good. If it looks good and is suspected to be correct, leave it. It doesn't matter what else is left.

In the first round, I even only looked at the catalog, about 10-20 pages. Once you are sure that the book is the correct one, file it.

This is the list of books I made on NOTION. After the books were bought and turned into electronic files, I only did two things in the first round.

1. Express the "feeling" of "turning through" the book in one or two sentences,
2. When I'm "free later", I can decide whether to "intensive" or "skimming" the book, or not to read it at all.

### Buy e-books as much as possible, or convert books to e-files

I have a strange hobby in the arena. I like to cut out the physical books I buy and convert them into e-books.

There are many benefits to doing this

1. The most intuitive is to reduce the space occupied by books. (When I really made up my mind to start digitizing books, in 2015, I noticed that my house was getting bigger and bigger, but when most of the space in the house was filled with books, I thought it would not work. I was like Pay for the house to live in, not for yourself)
2. After converting to electronic file, you can read it on the tablet. (Sometimes, I buy some new books and want to read them on the plane on a business trip, but if the luggage is stuffed with new books, it is really mentally retarded behavior. It is hard to take and heavy to death. If it is cut into electronic files, the flat version can be It's no problem to stuff hundreds of books)
3. After converting to electronic file, it is convenient for me to take notes. In fact, this is the most important reason.

In 2016, after I published the "Extreme Reading Method", it was very well received. Because of this reading method, the average person's time to read a book can be reduced from a few hours to 30 minutes.

The principle of the "speed reading method" is to quickly scan for drugs by reading books, extract keywords, and then organize them into experiences.

But this approach is not without its drawbacks. The biggest disadvantage of this method is that it has to be copied by hand. And when there are too many examples in a book, just copying the examples can be difficult. It is also very laborious to write notes when there are too many important points.

So, in 2018, I don't use this method. I use the "copy and paste method" instead.

What is the copy and paste method?

In fact, I copy and paste the words in the book, as long as I touch my sentences or examples, and paste them directly into my "first layer" reading "Golden Sentences" notes. After posting a book, I will rearrange these golden sentences, and then write what I understand.

The effect is the same. But there is absolutely no "physical fatigue" of "picking too much".

For example, I will copy the golden sentences from the books I found in the first round to the software "Curtain", and after a little typesetting, write them into my "Golden Sentence Notes".

Because to me, the golden sentence is what matters. Others are not important.

You can imagine that the "nutrient" in the book is the body, and the book is the "fiber". When you buy vegetables, you must wash them first, then cut them into pieces and mash them into mud. It is easy to eat raw, but the nutrients have not been absorbed. First, the soil on a pile of vegetables was indigestion and died.

### Use a modern vegetable cutter to help your reading efficiency

How to digitize the "content" of the book? There are several ways

a) Buy electronic files directly, such as books from KINDLE or some e-book manufacturers. After purchasing, you can use conversion software such as (EPUBOR) to convert it into a book format (EPUB) that can copy the content format

b) Use screenshot literacy software. Sometimes, books simply cannot be "transferred". Now that recognition software is very mature, there are some software that allow you to take screenshots of paragraphs and convert them into text. Anyway, you just want golden sentences! Just the OCR sentence is enough.

c) If the book is really focused, it is really troublesome to identify each piece, and it is not too late to identify the entire book with OCR software (OCR software identification is very computer-intensive)

That's why I like to scan all physical books into electronic files, because scanning into electronic files makes it easier for me to remove them.

If you read the physical book directly. It is psychologically and practically difficult to "cut out the words from the book and paste them on the notebook", not to mention that if you really do it, it will take invincible effort!

Basically, in the first round of buying books, I bought the electronic files as long as I could. The second round will buy the electronic + physical dual version. Because the entity can facilitate my general reading.

If I enter the third round of books, I will even buy a few more physical copies (collection, line drawing, clipping, gifting to others, etc.)

(ie if readers are interested in using this method, you can purchase the Marginnote3 software on iPad)

### Take note of golden sentences with Notion

I will put the converted and scanned book into DROPBOX, and then through the ZAPPIER automatic process software, each time a book is added, a new record will be added to my reading list.

Just bought it, I will go up to feel, TAG, TODO for each book.

In the second round, as long as you point out the title of the book above, I can paste the golden sentence in it!

### The third round of absorption: making fruit and vegetable juice, stir-frying home-cooked vegetables

And to the third round. I will do the absorbing action.

There are two ways to do this.

One is "fruit and vegetable juice"

Fruit juice is

1. Extract the golden sentence
2. Organize golden sentences
3. Organize and write down your comprehensive thoughts

The second is "fry a plate of home-cooked dishes"

stir fry is

1. Find the right process
2. Set up a process that you can do
3. Play together and see, at least 1-2 times

The difference between making fruit and vegetable juice and actually frying a round of home-cooked dishes is that the former is knowledge. The latter is to learn skills.

The reason why most people usually only reach the stage of "drinking fruit and vegetable juice" is because they are already exhausted in the reading process of ordinary people. What's more, how about trying to actually cook, arrange, and cut dishes?

Although vegetable juice is absorbed quickly, it stays in the body for a short time. There is no physical exercise to achieve a stronger curing effect.

but. If you can wash the vegetables, cut off the parts you don't want, cut them into small strips, make the vegetable juice, and then drink the cost of filtering, this is also much better than 99.99% of people.

Many friends always wonder why I am so excited about learning and able to persevere.

In fact, it's just because I actually always wash and cut it before eating it to avoid eating dirt.
