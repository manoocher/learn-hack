# Reading (4) Effectively use fragmented time to absorb book information

We have talked about so many methods before. But there is still one problem that has not been solved, where is the time?

Yes, this method seems to be very effective. But as an office worker, more practically, how can we spare the time to build this big system?

It may not be possible to sift through the first layer of books alone.

If you have this idea, it actually means that your cut-in thinking is wrong.

We all think that to read a book well, we need to set aside a large chunk of time.

But in fact, reading is never one action, but four actions. You need to cut out four different times.

1. Washing time
2. Cutting time
3. Time to eat/drink juice
4. Urine/Boo time

So when do we do these things?

About washing and chopping vegetables. You can use your weekends to sort through the books you just bought (either electronically or just flipping through them). This requires a more leisurely mentality. You can think of this as a housework like organizing a bookcase, and it will be more relaxed and happy.

And eat and drink juice. You can choose a more leisurely evening after get off work and spend an hour extracting golden sentences.

And usually after picking up one or two golden sentences, the magical brain may magically emerge and summarize some new ideas in a few days. Then you can post on FB. I call this moment the pee moment. Posing whenever an idea arises. (urin anywhere)

You also don't have to worry that PO has no time to organize at any time. You can simply wait for the washing time on the weekend to store them together.

As for stool, there is no need to force it. I think stool still requires some technology. You can wait to collect a little more urine, and it will naturally accumulate into a pile of stool.

But the point is that you must urinate and defecate. Only when it can be excreted can it be regarded as truly absorbed. And usually if you can grow up, it means that you have remembered this matter much more firmly than the average person.

### urination and defecation techniques

Some readers may be a little worried when they see this, urination and defecation need a threshold. In fact, if I really want to say, I think the threshold for urination is actually very low.

a) urinating

About peeing. You can use an ORID pattern.

In fact, this is also a mode of human observation, reflection, absorption of experience, and finally action. Anyone can do it anytime.

#### 1. O-"Objective": Observe the external objective, factual. Questions to understand objective facts are as follows:

- What did you see?
- Remember what?
- What happened?

#### 2. R-"Reflective": Pay attention to inner feelings, reactions. Questions that evoke emotions and feelings are as follows:

- What makes you very moved/surprised/sad/happy?
- What do you find difficult/easy/handling?
- What impressed you most?

#### 3. I-"Interpretive": Interpretation of meaning, value, experience. Questions looking for the aforementioned meaning and value are as follows:

- Why does this make you so moved/surprised/sad/happy?
- What made you think? Is there an important insight?
- What is important to you? What did you learn?

#### 4. D-"Decisional": Find out a decision, an action. The questions to identify resolutions and actions are as follows:

- Is there anything we can change?
- What will be the next actions/plans?
- What other resources or support are needed to accomplish the goal?
- How will you apply it in the future?

b) stool

And poop, I have to admit that this thing does have a bit of a threshold. But I think you can usually save a little pee and templates for easy output.

For example, I usually even have file templates, course templates, and even book writing templates. That's why I have such a perverted writing ability, I can even write a book in a day or two.

Because pooping does require skill! The large intestine also needs to be exercised!

No matter how bad it is, at least you have to practice the skills of being able to write a presentation slide (even without the actual presentation)!

Many people think that it is difficult to express their thoughts after reading (urine), or even make a slideshow (stool). This is actually because everyone does not know that these actions are to be done separately.

Even with a super-strong digestive system like me, it is difficult to output stool immediately after reading a book!

Many people even vomit directly after eating, not to mention urinating and urinating. It's no wonder that people always complain that they forget quickly after learning. Not to mention using it.

This is actually because you haven't been trained to "read your stomach"! Don't know how to use your digestive system to eat and get nutrients.

But it doesn't matter! Because 99.99% of humans don't know this method, or even know how to do it. As long as you know this method of urinating and defecating, you have already won hundreds of millions of people.
