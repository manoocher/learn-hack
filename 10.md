# Chapter 10 It only takes one year to become a master at the fastest

Of course, readers will still be a little worried when they see this. What I've taught before seems to be just a short-term quick-learning method. No, I just calculated it through some mathematical means

- Make some objects that we measure with our senses clearly visible
- It is not easy to set goals wrongly. Otherwise, I often just need to solve novice problems, and as a result, get lost in the entire forest of master problems.
- Again, because there are specific directions, there are also the number of topics. Therefore, the entire learning process becomes a progress bar, and the hard work will gradually become bearable. Because you can see the end.

But back to a real problem, we sometimes don't just want to learn technology in the short term. Most of the time, we want to carry out long-term field conquests. So how do we tackle this direction?

## Dreyfus models: Expert, Proficient, Competent, Advanced Novice, Novice

Regarding the progress of conquering the long-term field, the industry has a specific model: the Dreyfus model of skill acquisition, which divides the skill proficiency from top to bottom: experts, proficient, competent, and advanced novice. , five levels of novice.

In the process of conquering a field, the ability value can be divided into five stages:

- newbie
- Advanced Novice
- Competent
- proficient

Each area has relatively clear KPIs. Earlier, I mentioned in the blind spot of the novice teacher's design course, and there is no such thing as 1 \* / 10 of my own ability. This is because there are only five levels of ability. The level, practice direction and preparation method that each layer needs to reach are completely different. And the knowledge required for each layer grows exponentially, so it is impossible to teach you the knowledge that 1/10 of the masters know.

So, how long do we usually need to practice at each stage?

You might think there is no way to estimate this.

In the case of engineers, there are actually time statistics that are relatively close to the facts.

![](images/20211023164727.png)

- Advanced novice ranging from 2-3 months to 12-18 months (with or without a strong teacher)
- Competents range from 12-18 months to 24-36 months (with or without strong environmental immersion)
- Proficient from 18-24 months to 48-120 months (with or without environmental exercise)
- Experts rely on chance

In fact, the estimated time listed in this model is not only applicable to the engineer line. Most fields are also within this approximate time frame.

The time required depends on which stages you want to overcome, and whether you have found a good teacher in the middle to help you shorten the time.

Moreover, you may have heard one more thing, if you have reached the level of master or master in one field, usually the time you take to conquer another field will decrease exponentially. Master more fields, and the time required to learn a new subject will be greatly reduced.

So you really don't need 10,000 hours to learn a skill. Usually what we call "will" is at most the stage of advanced novice and competent person. According to this standard, if it is fast, it will be two or three months, and if it is slow, it will be at most more than a year.

You might think this number can't be this short.

In fact, it is possible, because the training and education of the company is like this. The company wants to make money, not to find someone to be a student and learn slowly.

The company's work training is basically that seniors lead juniors, first teach how to do (procedural knowledge), and then slowly add details (factual and conceptual knowledge), and get rapid growth results by solving different business problems and asking questions every day .

If a company still asks you to learn from the basics, then the company has collapsed long ago.

## Ghost Speed ​​Learning Method - How to compress the infinite learning journey to the speed of light

Again, from my own experience. I even feel that the number written in the table above is too high. This is the "natural" time the average person needs to study.

Naturally, it means reading books by chance, finding teachers by chance, finding companies with systematic training by chance, and having enough opportunities to practice. That is to say, the probability of the problem appearing is natural, and the probability of solving the problem is natural. You are just waiting there, passively assigned by the system to the learning machine.

But what if we take the initiative?

Let me present an angle you never thought of.

Why do we often feel that learning is limitless?

This is because often when we encounter a new problem point, in order to solve this problem, we may suddenly encounter 3-5 sub-problems. In order to solve these sub-problems, for each sub-problem, we will encounter 3-5 more grand-child problems.

then. . . . . If it doesn't continue, you will feel that it's endless and just give up.

Because you don't know how many problems there will be in the end, and how much time will you spend?

Let me ask you a question, how long will all the problems add up if you dig down to the bottom without creating new sub-problems. You probably never thought about it, did you?

And this question actually has an answer.

All we humans give up on endless questions is that our short-term memory can only hold 3-5 subtopics. This is the mathematical limit we can tolerate for a problem instantaneously. So when 1 question swells to 9-25 questions, we immediately crash. Naturally it will. . . .

But what if we think about it the other way around?

I wrote earlier that when we study, we can learn in reverse and complain about the problems we encounter. In fact, after sorting it out, there may only be about 9-25 questions. Then in fact, these nine questions can be classified into 3-5 categories.

In fact, I think almost all questions and answers in the world are basically 3 powers, and they exist in such a structure

- 1,2,3
- Front, Middle, Back
- input, processing, output
- what, why, how

Or the structure of various fields themselves

- (Learning) - Goals, Processes, How to Continue
- (Doing business) - Recruiting, serving, growing
- (Analysis of Financial Reports) - Profit Margin, Total Asset Turnover, Leverage

Okay. Suppose you encounter problems. We can all use the above steps to disassemble from the end in a "trilogy". Then dismantle until there are no particles.

So how many problems do we have to solve in total? We can exhaust the number of problems first, and try to calculate the possibilities to the power of 3.

- 3\*\*4 = 81
- 3\*\*5 = 243
- 3\*\*6 = 729
- 3\*\*7 = 2187
- 3\*\*8 = 6151

Suppose we solve a problem in 1 day

Then it may be necessary to:

- 90 days
- 8 months
- 2 years
- 5 years
- 16 years

In fact you will find that this is almost as close as it takes to become a (wild) advanced novice, competent, proficient, expert.

If you come back to see this watch again, will you find any subtleties?

![](images/20211023164727.png)

But in most of the market, as long as the person who is competent and proficient, everyone will think that he is an expert. And, more often, as soon as you reach an advanced novice level, people (who don't know anything at all) will think you're an expert.

And solving the problem takes a day. This is a looser grip.

Suppose if we solve a problem it takes 8 hours, that is, we only need 1/3 of the original time. (Assume we solve with machine or framework)

Then the required time becomes

- 30 days
- 90 days
- 8 months
- 2 years
- 5 years

And this number is close to the time required for advanced novice, competent, proficient and expert (lucky environment).

Of course we can go even shorter. Suppose a problem is only 1/3 of the time, which is 2.6 hours

then it becomes:

- 10 days
- 30 days
- 90 days
- 8 months
- 2 years

In fact, it's about as much time-consuming as it takes me to learn a new field now.

- Only 90 days to the competent person
- Time to master 8 months
- to specialist level within 2 years

Of course, my purpose in writing this book is not to brag about how exaggerated my own learning rate is. Rather, it's about empowering readers to do the same. I just use a mathematical model to show that this is a completely possible theory.

### Time and cost of light speed learning ability

How can we achieve such a perverted learning speed?

We just finished talking about the limit of the problem and listed the possibilities to the power of 3:

- 3\*\*4 = 81
- 3\*\*5 = 243
- 3\*\*6 = 729
- 3\*\*7 = 2187
- 3\*\*8 = 6151

But in fact I don't think a field can study 6151 questions. About 2187 questions are about the same.

So the solution is

- 81 Advanced Novices
  --243 Expert
- 729 Masters
- 2187 Expert

Suppose an advanced novice has 81 questions. A book can answer your 3 questions. You actually need 27 books.

and so on, so you need

- 27 books
- 81 books
- 243 books
- 729 books

In fact, it is unlikely that a field can buy 729 books. 243 is a more likely number. Because of the same field, the content of many books has a certain degree of repetition. I bought 400 books to study financial report analysis at the time. After I finished reading it, I felt like I read 81 different books.

And just now we said: Suppose the advanced novice has 81 questions. According to a book can solve your 3 problems. You actually need 27 books.

(You don't need to read the whole book, as long as that book can solve one of your sub-problems or grand-child problems, be practical!)

300 yuan for a book. 27 books is 8100 yuan. Solving a problem costs 100 bucks.

You read 27 books. Suppose that 1 book takes 1 day to read. That is 27 days to read (+ practice) to become an advanced novice.

It's not impossible for a 30-day advanced novice. That skilled person can do it in 90 days.

Also, reading is a relatively slow method. Usually I go to class. In theory, in some fields, I should be able to learn advanced novice even after 30 days of self-study. But if you go to a class taught by a master, you may learn it within 8,100 yuan a day. But time-wise I only need 1 day, not 30 days.

So the good class and the bad class are actually whether the original 30-day practice time can be shortened to 1 day, saving 30 times the time. Instead of finishing the class, not only the result is 0, but it even hits my self-confidence even more.

In this way, do you still feel that the goal of learning and exercise still seems far away?
