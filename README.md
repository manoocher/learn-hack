## behind the book

- What problem is this book trying to solve?
  - Solve the problem that the times are developing too fast, and the old learning methods and learning minds of human beings cannot keep up.
  - Humans have been installed with the wrong system by schools, resulting in a huge drop in learning speed
  - Human beings have been installed by society with misunderstood assumptions about society, resulting in decreased enthusiasm for life
- What exactly is its mission?
  - Let human beings regain their sense of mastery over life
  - Reintroduce humans to their inherently built-in and efficient learning methods
  - Break down learning barriers in any subject, skill, language
  - Propose a set of revolutionary learning methods and perspectives with low learning threshold but super effective.
- How does it justify the mission?
  - Through Cognitive Science
  - Through Brain Science
  - Simulation through mechanical structure
  - Dismantling through the game world
- What kind of assumption does it make?
  - The basic education of society teaches everyone a wrong limited education model, causing many people to be stuck in this game for life
  - The master is a drug addict, not a madman who works hard in the mountains
  - The "artificial" learning process we have always accepted is unscientific and anti-human
  - We humans have not been dismantled in depth on the subject of learning, but most of them are steel-making with a hard headbutt
- What is the process of reasoning?
  - Please read this book
- How to get this evidence?
  - Please read this book
- What conclusion can we draw in the end?
  - Everyone is born superhuman. You just don't know how to maximize the superpowers of the brain chip.
  - By reassembling the learning sequence, you can also have a hundred times more learning ability
- What does this conclusion mean to each of us?
  - Learn new things at a superhuman speed from now on
  - Easy to be a scholar
  - Study any subject, the speed can be reduced from five years to one year
  - People can not only study one major in a lifetime, but 5-10 majors.
