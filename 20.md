# Postscript

The process of writing this book was really hard work. I have rewritten the draft of this book at least three or four times. The topic of "learning" seems simple, but the complexity of the materials involved and the difficulty of organization are far beyond my original expectations.

But anyway, I ground the book out.

There are many difficulties in writing this book, but the strong driving force that supports my writing is that I hope that after the publication of this book, all human beings will not have to study so hard from now on.

I learned to read at the age of five. Since then, I have become very fond of reading and very fond of learning. Because the feeling of "learning" is so refreshing and addictive.

But after I was seven years old, after schooling, I became very unhappy. I started to feel why "learning" is medicine and reading for others. I don't even know what I'm reading if I read it for someone else's sake, and I'm getting a bunch of inexplicable punishments.

This torture didn't break free until I started working in my twenties. I have always wanted to use "the way I like to learn" to learn "the things I like", and I have also studied a lot of learning and note-taking methods in the middle.

And because I am an engineer, there are too many things for an engineer to learn programming technology. At the same time, it is also a great challenge to effectively teach the techniques that you know to your apprentices.

To address these professional issues, I have developed my own unique learning and teaching framework.

These materials and methods are the predecessors of the content of this book.

I opened an online programming school "full stack camp" in 2017, which is a collection of this method. I even had a brand new concept at the time (accompanied learning, peer learning, and game level design). Because of the online teaching before 2017, there were only film screenings at that time. But I have never felt that online teaching can only be done in this way (more importantly, the teaching effect of only playing videos is very poor, and the degree of abandonment in the general field is already high. In the programming world, there will even be people who follow the screen to play The typo results are inexplicably stuck.)

So I put a lot of effort into transplanting the offline mentoring mode, the mutual aid mode, the efficient self-learning incentive mode, and the mental model of the game to this online school. This school has achieved very good results, with a success rate of at least 70% (at that time, the online learning rate of the first class was only 10%). But at that time, the school had mixed reputations. On the one hand, people did not believe that this learning framework was so effective. On the other hand, this format was completely different from all the online teaching formats at that time (our programming school adopted half-text teaching and direct dialing). Answering questions, offline mutual aid associations), so it is not understood.

But I have always believed that my ideas and designs at the time were right, and this was the most efficient model for human learning. It is also the mode that can improve the participation rate and learning rate the most.

Later, in 2019, almost the vast majority of online training camps in mainland China have "revised and paid tribute" to this method.

The purpose of writing this book. On the one hand, I wanted to opensource the school's making of and underlying core concepts at that time. On the one hand, after a few years, I have gained a deeper understanding of the human mind, and I want to disassemble the things that were made by mistake and make them more scientific.

To this end, I read countless books on brain science, educational theory, and game design, disassembled all aspects of learning, and learned many sets of skills myself, and repeatedly tested this framework. This book builds superhuman learning.

I have always believed that learning can be scientific, people do not have to have a fixed mindset, and learning should be a joyful and joyful thing.

I also hope that after reading this book, everyone can also gain new happiness and new life brought by this book.
