# Reading articles (3) Make reading notes that can really remember the content

In this chapter we're going to talk about the note-taking part.

For a long time, many people are stuck with notes. The main sticking points are also mostly the same

- Taking notes is easy to get tired
- I don't know whether to remember the key points or not
- Should the focus be in a book or a notebook
- Notes are scattered all over the place and are also divided into many forms. How to organize them?
- The notes you write are not beautiful, but you can't seem to remember them if you make them beautifully
- After writing notes and forgetting after a while
- There are too many points in the book to memorize, and you get tired quickly

Therefore, there are not only many books on the market that improve reading ability, but also many books on improving notes. So what is your real problem with the note section?

Here I would like to present a chapter comparison chart. I think the real crux of the matter is not on the subject of notes.

But in the learning attitude.

Since childhood, our education is almost passive education. In school, you can't question what the teacher says, or even assume that the teacher is right. Desperately remembering information that is either right or wrong, and even absorbing it in an inefficient way.

And this study habit is also brought into the matter of reading.

The reason why many people feel that reading is very tiring is because when reading a book, they do not presuppose what questions they want to ask about the field. To be precise, what information they are searching for, and even assume that the information in the book is all correct ( But it's weird looking at it). Not to mention that many people read books or even recite word by word in their hearts (which consumes more energy).

If we dismantle this passage carefully, you will find that reading a book and making a notebook are several continuous actions.

1. Convert the image into sound in the brain, and then the sound is transcoded into understandable information
2. Determine whether this is information that should be copied
3. Manually copy the information on the copied book
4. Based on the information in the book, generate experience and write it again

If we compare the matter of reading and writing notes, it is likened to taking the freshly washed clothes into the room and organizing them into a wardrobe.

This means that you have to take out a piece of clothing from the laundry basket first, and if it is a piece of clothing, you have to shake it off, fold it up, and put it in the clothing compartment. Next, you pull out another pair of socks, flatten the socks, put two more pairs together, and put them in the sock grid of the closet. Next, take out another piece of underwear, turn the underwear upside down, fold it in half, and put it into the underwear grid of the wardrobe. . . Well, I won't go any further.

The point is, no normal person would take one piece and fold another and receive another like this. If there are about four pieces in a row, they may not have the strength!

The order that a normal person would do might be to pour out the washed clothes on the bed first, sort them roughly, fold the clothes and pants first, then the underwear, and then put on the socks. Then stack them in the closet.

why? Because doing so saves energy, you don't have to bend over to stand up, you don't have to walk around, and you don't have to cut and cut multiple times with different movements.

In retrospect, our continuous behavior of reading and taking notes seems natural, in fact

1. Convert the image into sound in the brain, and then the sound is transcoded into understandable information
2. Determine whether this is information that should be copied
3. Manually copy the information on the copied book
4. Based on the information in the book, generate experience and write it again

These four are all different things, and it takes a lot of effort for the brain to cut back and forth. So most people have no energy after reading a book (equivalent to folding a bucket of new clothes in general).

If you just thought my three-tier filtering method was weird and labor-intensive. Looking back at the example of folding clothes now, you may find that this is actually the less labor-intensive method.

Because I only need to concentrate on one thing at a time. For example, a quick summary of this book is a book to read and a book not to read. Just pick out the information you are interested in, and throw away the rest.

And because I used this three-layer arrangement method, in the end, I read all the information that I like and useful, and of course I will have a lot of fun!

Many people always think that I have a way to overcome the fear and burden of eating dirt, in fact I said that I never eat dirt!

### How to take the first level of notes

Next, let's talk about how to do the first level of notes.

In fact, the first layer of notes is similar to the first layer of screen calligraphy. I basically use two different tools.

a) Notion Reading List Organizer

I use a Notion form to record which books I have bought. There is only one sentence on it. After reading it, I have time to mark this book and how to deal with it.

2. An A4 notebook as index notes

Then prepare an A4 notebook to jot down scattered notes. And this note-taking method is not complicated. It's just like a diary, I write the time, and excerpt some golden sentences, or fragmentary thoughts and feelings.

You may find such notes too simplistic. Yes, it's that simple. Because my purpose is not to absorb it, but to use this notebook as a temporary storage box.

Usually after reading a book, we humans forget the content. But they still remember which book they read in which month, so this notebook is just to make it easy for my brain to come back to find "related content" on a daily basis.

If the first layer of notes is moved to the vegetable and fruit model. The action is to pick the fruit, peel it, and put it in the refrigerator.

## How to make second level notes

The second layer of notes is the excerpt of the golden sentence I just mentioned in the second round of sorting method.

![](images/20211024112821.png)

The golden sentence excerpt is to cut into pieces and make juice. But also temporarily in the refrigerator.

Why do we need to take second-level notes? This is because the vast majority of people are stuck on "how to take notes". The most common questions are:

![](images/20211024112921.png)

Not sure what to remember. Tired of even remembering. As a result, I didn't have the strength to organize it after memorizing it, and then I forgot the content in the end.

But in fact, the notes need to be subdivided, and there are two actions, one is "recording information" and the other is "organizing experience". The brain is only powerful enough to do one thing at a time. If you do two things at the same time, it is easy to lose the energy on the spot.

So what we need to do is to separate "record" and "organize experience" into two actions. And records don't need to be too obsessive, they are copied by hand.

In the past, I introduced the method of speed reading in "Building a Superhuman Brain". The principle is to look for keywords with questions, and then quickly find the keywords, write three sentences on the spot as the experience, and then repeat it to friends.

Now I'm more lazy and I don't have to write by hand. Instead, use electronic excerpts of golden sentences. The advantage is that sometimes you see good theories, but you also need to attach examples to explain, and you can quickly save them in the form of electronic excerpts.

This can save yourself a lot of effort. Because the key point is to "save effort" in the excerpts. Once the effort is saved and it can be done in a short period of time, the brain is usually willing to do it all the time.

Of course, the result of this excerpt is not very beautiful, and even messy. That's okay too. As long as you organize the categories in a short period of time and write down your own experiences, the brain can usually remember it very firmly.

### How to make the third layer of notes

Next we will enter the third layer of notes.

And the third layer of notes I also divided into two kinds of urine and stool.

a) urinating

Urine is usually after I have picked up some golden sentences from books, I will post a brief summary of my experience on FB after a few days. These experiences are usually brief and casual. But after sharing it, I remember it better.

b) stool

Defecation is a further arrangement of practical practices and routines. Or make a PPT.

![](images/20211024113022.png)

For example, this "building superhuman reading ability" methodology is my "poo".

I organized the whole practice into a new system and method.

The advantage of this is that I can go through the process one time, and the next time I do it, it can be several times faster. Even more and more mature, become muscle memory.
