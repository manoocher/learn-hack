# Chapter 3 Learn to cut watermelon from the middle

We've spent two large chapters earlier on the importance of game types, goals, and visual progression.

This is because the difference in the type of game and the goal of the game determines whether the entire game is fun or not, and how long the path takes.

It can even be said that the pain we suffer in deliberate learning is almost always caused by not understanding the type of game. And this mistake leads to all kinds of wrong decisions and pains that follow.

## Active Learning and Passive Learning

Deliberate learning is also divided into two types: one is "active learning" and the other is "passive learning".

Active learning is when we decide for ourselves what we want to learn. In passive learning, others decide what we want to learn.

The RPG reverse learning method we mentioned earlier is actually about active learning, and it is also an efficient active learning method.

And the education we receive in school is mostly passive learning, we learn what others arrange for us to learn.

We take the initiative to learn what we want to learn, or choose a way that we are interested in and that is in line with our own pace to learn. As a result, of course, it is much more pleasant to come than others to stuff a bunch of things we don't know what to do.

However, at this point, readers may be a little confused. Isn't the level of the RPG in the game designed by someone else? Why do we also play with gusto?

### Teachers do not know how to design correct teaching goals

There is actually a secret behind this. I only found out after I became a teacher.

We often think that teachers should be the same as the designers of the game world. They all know how to design the goals and levels of the game, and lead students to the correct goals and paths.

In reality, the extent of both is far from what it was designed to do.

First of all, the game design company knows what the game goal of a game will be in the end, so it can decompose the appropriate level and challenge difficulty design to achieve this goal. Moreover, the purpose of the game companies is to keep your high concentration addiction playing, and even pay to keep it, so they will even pay attention to every minute you maintain a pleasant experience.

Ordinary teachers, but not far. There are several key factors in this:

- Most teachers are relatively experienced people in the field. They only understand the domain technology, but do not understand the teaching experience design. The two are different professions.
- Most of the teachers only know how to teach in lectures, that is, he shares his experience with you to "listen". If we learn to only listen to the sound to learn knowledge, it can be said to be very laborious.
- What is even more shocking is that you think that the teacher understands learning goal setting. Even if it is hard to learn, and follow his path to follow the map and copy, in fact, most of them can still reach the final road. But frankly speaking, most teachers, in fact, are just messing around with their learning goals. By their design, you can't learn anything at all.

You might be shocked to hear this. But in fact, this situation is not uncommon at all.

We mentioned that the skills of domain technology and teaching experience design are two different things. The technology is very powerful, it does not mean that the teacher is very good at teaching.

And what's even worse is that the teaching goals he designed are impossible to produce any results. Because of this type of teacher, his teaching goals and teaching materials are designed as follows:

- First, list the gap between you and him. (even the other party may be a master in the field)
- Then, his goal is to copy you to 1/10 of his power within two weeks.
- So, he just gives you all the knowledge he knows, each topic, and 1/10 of the fragments to form a long teaching material for you.

Thus, this results in the following class situation:

- The teacher is drooling in class and looks very good, but you don't understand anything after listening to it
- Because of these 1/10 knowledge, the capacity is also very large, so it may not be finished in two days
- So these courses, the content will become very deformed, everything is a little bit, and everything is not in-depth
- Because there is not enough time to talk about these contents, the most important "practice once" or even "practice several times" is directly skipped.

So students start to feel frustrated:

- The level of the teacher is fine, but I seem to have problems with comprehension
- Can't understand in class
- Falling asleep in class
- Failed to practice at home

It's not the student's fault at all. The key is that the master, the steps he practiced at the beginning, did not follow this process at all.

Mathematically piecing together 1/10 knowledge does not guarantee 1/10 results. Because learning skills are not accumulated and measured in this way.

So you can't learn a technology. Have students' own goal-setting problems. There are even teacher goal-setting problems.

That's why we've spent a lot of space at the very beginning of this book explaining the importance of goal setting. Because there are many factors that affect the learning effect. But the consequences of wrong goal setting and process planning are paramount.

## Don't learn from the basics, but from the process

Another key factor is that we often feel that starting from a blank sheet of paper, our priority is to learn the basics. Once the basics are learned, we can start practicing.

But this is also inefficient. If I say this, readers will not understand. Let me use the analogy of teaching cooking:

Suppose our original goal was to learn to fry a steak in one hour.

If you just copy 1/10 of the knowledge, and learn from the basics.

Then the class will look like this:

For an hour, at the beginning of the course, the teacher will show you the anatomy of the cow. Each part will tell you how well cooked each part is, and he will emphasize that if the part is selected for the wrong degree of doneness, it will be very unpalatable. Then start to explain the principle of the Mena reaction, and what kind of pot or oven we use to fry the steak, and the cooking methods and processes that various chefs like to use. At the 50th minute, I take out a piece of meat that you don't know what part it is, and then I quickly fry it in front of you, and then I end the class because I don't have enough time.

The steak fried by the teacher on the spot is delicious. But when you get home, you find that although you have copied a lot of notes in class, you can’t do it when you review it after class. It’s not that the meat is too cooked and the gravy is flowing, or it’s too raw no matter how you fry it. Then you start to wonder if you don't have the talent for cooking.

Sounds like this kind of teaching process is very unreasonable. But in fact, all kinds of teaching large-scale rollover scenes in the society are like this.

So, how should teachers teach? How should we learn?

In fact reasonable practices, and teachers who will teach:

It is to directly choose a piece of meat that is not easy to fry for beginners, and it will not taste too bad if it is cooked, such as boneless beef short ribs. Then, they will directly demonstrate how to return the meat to the initial temperature suitable for frying, put the meat down, and turn it over when you see any color. It is best to let it sit for a few minutes after baking. Finally let you do it again.

It's that simple. There are a few key points:

- with a clear purpose
- Do not learn knowledge that is "not directly related" to this goal and "cannot be understood without doing it once"
- Copy the process once and practice on the spot
- Feel the difference between what the teacher does and what you do. Have the opportunity to ask the teacher how to adjust the parameters and experience it several times.

## Learn from process knowledge

When you hear about this new process, you might think something looks weird. It seems like the new process seems reasonable, but it feels too simple. If you only learn this little thing, can you really learn the whole process yourself in the future?

Do those underlying principles really need to be understood and recited? Our past experience seems to tell us that unfamiliar basics are deadly dangerous. Is it really good to "learn from the middle"?

In fact, this is because the "foundation" of our "cognition" is very different from the "foundation" of our "need".

In the whole teaching world, the input knowledge is divided into four categories:

![](images/20211023160805.png)

(Classification of Knowledge) (from Bloom's Taxonomy of Education)

If we put the four categories back into the example of steak, you'll find

- The process from defrosting steak to frying is "procedural knowledge".
- How well-done the steak is, and which meat colors are divided into. What is the principle of the Mena reaction, the source of deliciousness, is "factual knowledge".
- How to judge and control maturity is "conceptual knowledge".
- The self-adjusting assessment of knowing whether you are doing well or not is "metacognitive knowledge".

You will find that if we don't learn "procedural knowledge" first, we first learn a truckload of "factual knowledge", "conceptual knowledge", and "metacognitive knowledge". Steak, and after a few weeks, even hope these things are clean again.

However, if we learn "procedural knowledge" first, because we remember that "feeling", the subsequent "factual knowledge" and "conceptual knowledge" will stick to it better. Because it is "related to your goals" and related to "the process of previous learning".

![](images/20211023161545.png)

This discovery may shock you. It turns out that we have misunderstood the definition of "foundation" from the past to the present.

Yes, even this is what we spend so much time growing up, learning so much in school, and forgetting everything when we go out to society. In the workplace, we follow the teachings of our predecessors without knowing the reason, and we go through it in a confused way, but the learning process is very fast, and it is not easy to forget the reasons.

That's why I say that the education of the entire school system is, in essence, quite harmful. This system has broken our "goal setting" and "strategic design" since childhood, and even let us learn in the "reverse direction" during the learning process.

This is actually what happens in K12 every day: in the "short-term quiz competition", the "remembering accuracy" of "factual knowledge" is tested, and then it is forgotten after two weeks.

What we think of as an education system is actually not an education system. In essence, the purpose of K12 is more like a KPI-oriented nursery school (in an industrialized-oriented society, parents have no time to educate their children, and can only send their children to centralized education places). The teacher's achievement evaluation is not based on the level of making students "useful to society", but how many places the entire school squeezes into.

And the so-called "procedural knowledge" is relatively difficult to quantify and score. In terms of the design criteria for scoring, it is much simpler to use "factual knowledge" and "conceptual knowledge" as a test, and the perfect degree of recitation as a KPI basis.

So the whole teaching process and goals will be twisted into a class that only teaches a bunch of trivial knowledge of beans, and then a group of people PK who can memorize it flawlessly. But in the end, there was no time for students to fully experience the operation process. Repeatedly for several years, students are also twisted into thinking that the future world is just how it works. Learning also requires learning.

So far, we have talked about

- Limited and unlimited games
- Deliberate and natural learning
- Passive and active learning

You may find that, in fact, the built-in learning model of our human beings is originally a more scientific and efficient way. Not to mention that we also have a built-in super-strong "mirror neuron" replication function, which is a function that current computers and artificial intelligence do not have.

It's just these functions that we have been forced to close by some inexplicable social system.
