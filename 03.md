# Third chapter Cuta from the middle

We spent two chapters in front of the two chapters, taking the importance of game type, goals and visual progress.

Because this is because the different game type is different from the game goal, the key determines how long the game is good, and how long the path time is.

It can even be said that we are in deliberate learning, almost all because they don't understand the type of game. This error triggers decision and pain in the latter mistakes.

## Active learning and passive learning

Deliberately study, it is also divided into two types: one is "active learning", one is "passive learning".

Active learning is what we have decided to learn what we want. And passive learning is that others decide what we want to learn.

The RPG reverse learning method we mentioned earlier is actively learning, and it is still an efficient active learning method.

And we have accepted by schools, most of them belong to passive learning, others arrange what we learn, what we learn.

What we take the initiative to learn what it is, or picks us to be interested, and in line with our own progress. As a result, of course, it is better than others who don't know what to do, and there is a lot of pleasants.

However, writing here, readers may be a little doubt. RPG inside the game is not the design of others? Why are we also played with Jinjin?

### Teacher does not understand the design correct teaching objectives

There is also a secret behind this. I am also known after the teacher.

We often think that the teacher is the same as the designer of the game world, know how to design the game's goals and level, with students to go to the correct goals and roads.

In fact, the extent to which the two is very far away.

First of all, the game design company knows what a game's game goal will be finally, thus disassemblies the appropriate level and challenge difficulty design in this purpose. Moreover, the purpose of the game company is to let your high-profile addiction to play, even pay for continuing, so they even pay attention to you all in the pleasure every minute.

The general teacher can be far away. There are several key factors in this:

- Most teachers, just relatively experienced people in the field. They only understand the field technology and do not understand the teaching experience design. Both are different majors.
- Most teachers, lectures only understand the story, that is, he shared his experience to "listen". If we learn only to listen to sound learning knowledge, it is very laborious.
- More shocking is that you think that the teacher knows the learning target setting, even if you study hard, according to his road, according to the picture, it can still go to the last road. But frankly, most teachers, in fact, for learning goals, actually a chaotic one. According to their design, you can't learn anything.

I might be shocked here. But in fact, this situation is not rare.

We mentioned that the skills of the domain technology and teaching experience, which is two codons. Technology is very powerful, does not mean that this teacher will teach.

And in fact, it is that the teaching goal of his design is impossible to produce any results. Because of this type of teacher, his teaching goals and textbooks are designed:

- First, list your gap with him. (Even the other party may be the field master)
- Then, his goal is to copy you within two weeks to his skill 1/10.
- So, he just knows all the knowledge, each theme, and add 1/10 into a long section of the textbook to you.

Therefore, this will produce the following case:

- Teacher's class is flying, it looks very powerful, but you don't understand anything after you listen.
- Because these 1/10 knowledge, there are also many capacities, so the time two days may not finish
- So these courses will become very deformed, all things are talking, all things are not deeply
- Because time light is not enough, it is not enough, so the most important "Practice once again", even "training a few times", it is directly skipped.

So students will start to produce frustration:

- There is no problem with the degree of teacher, but I seem to have a problem.
- I don't understand the class.
- I want to sleep in class.
- Going home to practice has been failed

This is not a student's fault. The key is that this master is the step of practicing the steps, which is not in accordance with this process.

Mathematically put 1/10 knowledge is patch up, and there is no guarantee that there is a 1/10 result. Because learning skills are not as cumulative and measured.

So learning a technology can't learn. There are students' own goals setting problems. Even the teacher's goal setting problem.

That's why we spent a lot of space in this book, explaining the importance of the target setting. There is a lot of factors affecting the learning effect. But the object settings, the resequence of the process planning errors.

## Don't learn from the basis, and learn from the process

There is also a key factor, which we often feel that from a white paper, we prefer to learn the basics. Basic knowledge learned, we can start practicing.

But this is also an inefficient practice. I don't quite understand this. Let me be metaphor for cooking:

Suppose our original goal is to learn to learn to fry one hour.

If you have justified 1/10, you will learn from the basics.

Then the course will turn this:

An hour, the beginning of the course takes you to see the anatomical map of you, every part is to suit you, and emphasize if the part is picking the wrong degree, it will be difficult to eat. Then start explaining the principle of Mener's reaction, and what kind of pot or oven we want to use steaks, all kinds of chefs like cooking methods and processes. When I got out of the fifty minute, I didn't know what part of the part, and then quickly fried in front of you, and then because of time is not enough.

The teacher fried on the scene is very delicious. But let's go home, although I copied a full note, I can't do it when I review the class, I can't do it. It is too cooked in the meat, and the graffles are flowing, otherwise, how to fry. Then you start to doubt yourself that you have not cited talents.

It is unreasonable to sound such a teaching process. But in fact, various teaching and large rollover scenes in society are all like this.

So, what should the teacher teach? What should we learn?

In fact reasonable practices, as well as teachers who will teach:

It is a meat that directly picks a newcomer is not easy to fry, and you will not eat too bad, such as bone cattle. Then the site directly demonstrates how to return to the initial temperature of the fried, the meat is put down, see what color is finished. Put it for a few minutes after it is baked. Finally, let you do it.

It's that simple. There are several key points:

- with a clear purpose
- Do not learn to "no direct related" with this goal and "no understanding of it is unable to understand"
- Copy the process again, and practice on the spot
- Do not do what you do with yourself. Have the opportunity to adjust the parameters to the teacher, and actually experience a few times.

## From process knowledge

I may think where you look weird. It seems that the new process looks reasonable, but it feels too simple. Just learn this thing, really follow yourself to learn the entire process?

The principles of the underlying really don't need to know and recite? Our past experience seems to tell us that unfoundation is very dangerous. This is really good to "learn from the middle"?

In fact, this is because we "cognition" "foundation", which is very different from the "foundation" that is actually "need".

In the whole teaching world, the knowledge entered into four major species:

(Knowledge classification table) (from Broome Education)

If we put four major classes back to the steak, you will find

- The process from thawing steaks to frying is "programmatic knowledge".
- Steak is a few minutes, which meat colors are divided into. The delicious source Mena response principle is what is "factual knowledge".
- How to determine, control the degree, is "conceptual knowledge".
- I know that I have a good self-adjustment assessment is "Yuan Cognitive Knowledge".

You will find that if we don't learn "procedural knowledge", learn a truck "factual knowledge", "conceptual knowledge", "yuan cognitive knowledge", there seems to be no fart, usually do not do it Steak, then there are only a few worships, and even do these east hope to clean.

However, if we learn "procedural knowledge", you can remember the "feeling", follow-up "factual knowledge" and "conceptual knowledge", but better stick to it. Because "related to your goals", it is related to "Process".

This finding may make you feel shocked. It turns out that we have made the definition of "foundation" from the previous time.

Yes, even this is how much time we have learned from small to the big flowers, so many things in school, but the society is forgotten. And in the workplace, it is unknown, in accordance with the predecessors, the paste is painted, the process of learning is very fast, and even if it is not easy to forget.

That's why I said the education of the entire school system, which is essentially harmful. The system has broken our "target setting", "strategic design" from a small system, and even the process of learning "anti-direction" learning.

This is in fact that K12 occurs every day: "In short test competition" test "factual knowledge" "" memory accuracy ", then forget it after two weeks.

We think the education system is actually not an education system. In essence, the purpose of K12, like the essence is the nature of KPI-oriented nursery (industrially oriented society, so that parents don't have time to educate children, can only send children to centralized education). The teacher's achievement evaluation, its measurement level is not a person who is "useful to the society", but the number of people squeezed into many schools.

And so-called "programmatic knowledge", it is difficult to quantify the score. In terms of design criteria, use "factual knowledge" and "conceptual knowledge" as tests, with the perfection of memorial, as a KPI basis, simple.

So the entire teaching process and goals will be twisted into the class, and only a pile of trivial beans in class, and then a group of people PK who will be a perfect. But in the end, there is no time to allow students to completely experience the operational process over again. In the case of a few years, the students are still distorted to the world that is the future, is so working. Learning is also trying to learn this.

When we talk now, we speak

- Limited games and infinite games
- Deliberate learning and natural learning
- Diagnosis and active learning

You may find that in fact, our human beings are born in built-in learning model, which is a more scientific and efficient practice. Not to mention that we have a superior "mirror neuron" replication function, it is the function of current computers and artificial wisdom.

Just these features, we have been mandated by some inexplicable social systems.
