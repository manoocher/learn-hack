# Chapter 8 Flow Learning Method "Skills in Practice"

in 2017. I once built the world's largest program online learning Codecamp "full stack camp".

At the end of this project, as many as 70% of the students who have completed the whole course, the background of the students in the class are all novices with no computer background.

This codecamp lasts for 2 months in total. Many students find it amazing that they can survive two months and even become addicted to programming.

> Student experience: Addicted again and again, addicted to Coding

> Student experience: programming development has become an addictive thing, and will think about how the website should be done in many scenarios and times, and how to learn from other people's websites. At the same time, I have a better understanding of my own learning curve and have a more tenacious will to learn.

##2017 Let students learn programming online for two months, and finally addicted to the "full stack camp"

Let me tear down how Full Stack Camp does this.

### Stage 1: Purpose---Epic Meaning & Calling

Before enrolling in the course, I set the goal of this study as "reborn as the next self that I want".

(This is also the effect of the registration questionnaire, many people most want to finish this course)

It is clearly defined that the learning goal of this time is to have a way to become a full-stack engineer who can combine his original interests and make hands-on products within one year.

### Stage 2: Gameplay --- Routine

In the first three weeks of the course, we designed several teaching levels to let students master the basic routines of writing a website.

At this stage, students already have the means to put together a simple forum outcome.

### **Stage 3: First Small Victory --- Ah-ha Moment**

Then, we held our first online development competition. Invite students to use the first three weeks of study to revamp the website into a unique recruitment website.

This job site is not difficult to implement. The difficulty lies in users adding more features and decorating their website.

Being able to do this makes students feel that they are also capable

### Stage 4: Skill Progress --- Progress and Accomplishment Development & Accomplishment

During this process, students can feel their own learning progress.

### Stage 5 & 6: Character Development --- Ownership & Possession & Unique Treasure Chest Medals --- Scarcity & Desire Scarcity & Impatience

During the course of the class, the progress of the coursework, the assignments submitted, the medals received, and the entries will be recorded on the personal homepage.

### Stage 7 & Stage 8 Surprise Levels---Unpredictability & Curiosity & Experience Social Sharing---Social Influence & Relatedness

There are a total of two competitions in the first phase of the full stack camp. One is the Job Listing contest and one is the JDStore contest. The competition mainly challenges:

- How to split missions and work with teammates
- Code implementation ability (Github original code public)
- Product Completion
- Popularity

This contest led to several unexpected results:

- Students observe each other's Github source code and learn about each other's functions
- Students share tutorial articles with each other on the forum, instruct other students to add functions, and canvass for their own works by the way
- Message each other to cheer each other on the work page
- During the process of canvassing votes and competitions, the students absorbed the encouragement and help of strangers, relatives and friends from each other. Full of surprises and rewards. Many students even ask for leave from work to use the scull code, just to focus on winning the competition

## Full stack camp students' reflections

Camp for the first time. I received 94 impressions. The excerpts are as follows. You can feel the power of this programming class.

> After participating in full stack learning for so long, what do you think is the biggest difference between you and before? Learned to take the initiative to learn, more confident in myself, no longer afraid of challenges. Write orid every day to make your logic clearer. Using the method of active learning, doing extraction exercises many times, I feel that the speed of learning things has become faster. I cherish my attention and time very much, and I spend my time studying when I am productive. I used to be withdrawn, but now I like to make new friends and take the initiative to help those in need. I feel that my sense of happiness is greatly enhanced. And after helping others, there will be many unexpected gains. With 16 grids for taking notes, the retention rate of reading and reading articles is greatly increased. And also try to write notes to share with friends. If I was asked to do something that I had never done before, I would definitely be afraid, but after participating in the full stack camp, I am no longer afraid.

> After participating in full stack learning for so long, what do you think is the biggest difference between you and before? There is no fear of learning new knowledge in any new field, and there is a relatively clear way. By constantly making small products, you will not consume your willpower and interest and curiosity in new fields by burying yourself in basic knowledge. Mainly for the purpose of being Xiaoxi and making myself happy, I kept moving forward. In time, I heard the importance of the basic knowledge of the front tune of many great people. I also decided to learn the basic knowledge on the premise of maintaining my inner fighting ability and interest. In the process of solving the bug, my English reading ability has improved greatly, and I have the urge to practice spoken English and go to work abroad. Completely eliminated the garbage learning method of the past and found that the world is so big and so beautiful

> After participating in full stack learning for so long, what do you think is the biggest difference between you and before? Gradually get used to it in full-stack learning, and write what I know into technical documents. In this process, it is another knowledge extraction. From when you think you understand, to when you really understand. And what the hell is muscle memory, I finally understand something. The biggest difference is that you don't have to worry too much about what you don't understand! It also gradually changed from asking "Du Niang" to ask Google. Suddenly, the world feels a lot clearer!

## Build a programming class as a video game

Why is this class so powerful. It is because I designed this course according to the idea of ​​designing games in the game industry.

Generally speaking, when it comes to gamification of courses, most of them refer to the introduction of the PBL (Point-Badge-Leaderbord) mechanism into the course system.

However, that's not what I did.

Specifically, I designed it with reference to the basic structure of the game and player dynamics.

### Four stages of the game: Discover / Onboarding / Scaffolding / Endgame

The game industry is designing games. The game will be divided into four stages:

Discovery => Onboarding => Scaffolding => The Endgame。

Game designers follow this design routine in game design. Make sure that players gradually develop a groping, habit, and even addiction to the game in the process.

Make sure to immerse yourself in this game every second. More than 80% of the fun games are accompanied by this routine.

The general design process is:

During the Onboarding phase of the game. The game will implant an Epic Calling (Call of Duty) at this stage to let players know exactly what the purpose of the game is. For example, in a restaurant time management game, the player's mission is to open a great restaurant, and the restaurant can serve food on time. For example, in sniper games, the player's mission is to become a legendary sniper in the battles of World War II.

Then in the first few chapters, through a series of small teaching levels, let players understand the core gameplay and develop "specific operating habits in the game".

And through small achievements, players can get their first ah-ha moment (small victory).

In the case of sniper games, the level in the first chapter will be triggered through some small series of events, allowing players to learn how to run, squat, ambush, enter the bunkers, and aim and shoot to assassinate. Then at the end of the first level, arrange a low-difficulty big boss for the player to try to assassinate, making the player feel like a sniper, really talented!

Then in the later process, players will gradually realize that they have a clear upgrade. And will put in the effort to develop and cultivate their own role. Then introduced the element of scarcity (collecting treasures).

Take the sniper game as an example, in the process of the game, after the player learns to pass the level, the next step will be to spend time developing their own characters, to upgrade their attributes and upgrade their guns according to the style of play they are good at. Adjust the gun SET on your body, modify the parts of the gun, and increase the rate of fire and the number of bullets carried.

Then, in the process of passing the level, some rare treasures will be found accidentally, and some badges will be triggered. Some players are even persistent in replaying to get the gold medal.

Among them, the unexpected surprises that continue to appear will also set off the challenges and curiosity of players.

Finally, at the end of the game, there will also be an element of "social sharing". Players can share videos of their kills on social networks, as well as share screenshots of their badges. Enjoy adoration from friends.

This is why players are so addicted to the game that they cannot extricate themselves.

Players can experience in the game that they continue to grow with their skill proficiency. Looking forward to the next challenge. And every time you learn a new skill or pass a new level, you will get amazing rewards.

So, playing games is a more and more enjoyable process.

You can compare this paragraph with the previous chapter "2020 Animal Crossing" and "2017 Full Stack Camp" to see if the structure is very similar.

## Why do humans hate studying in school and addicted to games.

You may wonder, can learning do this?

Actually it is possible. School is very boring now. This is because 90% of school education and classrooms are often narrated, which is the most convenient way for teachers to teach, but the most painful for students to learn, and the worst way to learn at the same time.

The content is not interesting and the genre is hard to absorb (and forget it after listening to it), anyone will find it a pain to learn.

Secondly, the general curriculum design does not have a clear teaching goal design, that is, teachers teach what they know based on what they know.

Rather than actually setting and testing goals, what students actually become after taking the course.

Naturally, students become more and more confused when studying, and even begin to doubt themselves.

In this process, there is nothing to learn, no goals, and lack of positive feedback for homework. Of course no one wants to learn.

Why is the game so addicting?

This is because in the game, everything is the opposite of "Education 1.0".

Different from real classroom learning, the game has a clear goal, and no matter what action you do in the game, there is clear feedback. You can see your own growth, and there is a reward system that doesn't exist in reality.

Many people have poor academic performance in reality. In the online battle royale game, there are various modifications, dodging, gun pressing, and sniping skills, which are superb. Obviously, it's not a question of learning ability at all.

But the genre, design, and teaching method of learning have a big problem.

Many people think that the gamification of education is to copy the elements in the game, such as points, badges, and leaderboards.

This is only seen on its table.

The foundation of everything lies in "target design", "pure learning style", "instant feedback mechanism", "timely motivation mechanism" and "variable reward mechanism".

## How to transplant the game genre to self-study and become addicted to learning?

The reason why I learn things by myself is very fast. It was after he figured out this routine that he transplanted him into his own self-learning system.

And this framework is also the "hero's journey" of ordinary people.

### Stage 1: Purpose---Epic Meaning & Calling

First of all, I will set a very strong learning goal for myself.

For example, to make a website a day, write a book a day. Make an online class that allows everyone to learn programming online and is highly addictive. It takes 3 minutes to analyze a financial report and make investment judgments.

This unprecedented goal that no one has achieved, I would love to challenge it!

### Stage 2: Gameplay --- Routine

Of course this is not a one-step process. In reality, there is no ready-made method.

I will break this big goal down into very small problems. (And this little question, simple enough for me to act.)

Even read a lot of books, just to understand the smallest knowledge points. (See Chapter 7 of this book for details)

Next, I'll figure out how to find the first set of procedural knowledge. Make the first small routine. Complete the first quick mini-completion.

### Stage 3: First Small Victory --- Ah-ha Moment

When I make the first small reach:

- Make a website a week
- Write a book in a month
- When making a DuPont analysis to visually dismantle the five-year ROE structure of the financial report

There will be a strong sense of progress and self-affirmation.

### Stage 4: Skill Progress --- Progress and Accomplishment Development & Accomplishment

So I will build on this result.

Look for the second trick, the third trick.

Finally, put these routines together into a big routine. Complete even more amazing achievements.

for example:

- Can make a website in a day
- Write a book a week

### Stage 5 & 6: Character Development --- Ownership & Possession & Unique Treasure Chest Medals --- Scarcity & Desire Scarcity & Impatience

Then, I might go to a competition to test my ability. Also see if your abilities are unique.

So I'm going to the Facebook hackathon.

And challenged to write a book a day, this weird thing.

### Stage 7 & Stage 8 Surprise Levels---Unpredictability & Curiosity & Experience Social Sharing---Social Influence & Relatedness

And, in the process, the best and easiest way to motivate yourself.

That is, I will share my strategies and practices on the Internet.

This is the fastest way to get Rewards, Variable Rewards, and Social Influence.

Because when you publish your work, someone is sure to praise you.

A compliment from someone you don't know and is famous for is a "variable reward" for you.

And publishing these strategies will also give you a sense of satisfaction in social influence.

## Why does the average person's hero's journey fail?

Of course, some people will ask: This is the way ordinary people struggle!

It is nothing special!

Yeah! But why can I (now) do it. But what about me before, what other people can't do now?

### Motivation and Ability

BJ Fogg of Yale University published a paper in 2009, summarizing how to improve the conversion rate by design, the occurrence of behavior, the key formula is Motivation-Ability-Trigger (Motivation-Ability-Trigger)

Mention Behavior = Motivation x Ability x Trigger

as a student. There are thousands of reasons not to act. But in a word, there are two reasons:

- the threshold is too high
- not motivated enough

### Insufficient ability

We as students. Many people want to go to the sky in one step.

- When you come up to learn something, you will abandon the novice teaching materials and choose the difficult ones.
- I learned something from the teacher, and I want to modify it into my own version before running through the first process
- Many of the most basic doubts have not been answered

As the saying goes: "If you take too many steps, you will be dragged into the egg".

So when I was teaching myself, I was very vigilant. Be sure to let yourself in the learning process, but choose simple and understandable learning.

Skip if you don't understand. So I bought super simple novice tutorials when I was teaching myself.

Then look up the master's book only as a dictionary.

If you can, go to the novice class opened by the master and learn routines happily.

### Not enough motivation

When I find myself capable, but not motivated enough to last.

I would think, why am I not motivated to continue practicing? It's because I don't need it.

Or the "short-term" "momentum" stimulus is not enough. Go to the octagonal frame to find an element that can generate strong motivation for me, hook it up, and I will be full of fighting spirit.

(For example, what works best for the average person may be: money, social capital. What works better for me may be social capital, rarity, and epic summoning.)
